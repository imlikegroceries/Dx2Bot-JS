A new version of Alanael's original [Dx2-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Alenael/Dx2-DiscordBot) rewritten in JS (because I don't know C#) and updated to work with slash commands.

All commands, besides the gatekeeper ones, have been ported over.

The new command '/dx2banner' returns the current banners and can simulate the probabilities of rolling on them.
