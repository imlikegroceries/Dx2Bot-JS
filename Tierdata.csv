"Adramelech","P","PT","4","4","4","5","5","
Sun God's Majesty punishes any form of MP restore, burning 1 MP and dealing 30% Fractional damage to their entire team, while also renewing Barriers for your team. This makes him an incredibly strong counter to MP-batteries like Alice A, Angra Mainyu and Beelzebubâ˜†.
In addition, Sun God's Majesty provides him Fire Pierce and more importantly +25% to Fire damage - this gives him a whopping +60% to Fire damage in Purple, even with ZERO transfers and ZERO panels. When combined with Sacrificial Inferno's colossal Base Power (which also ignores Endures), Adramelech can easily nuke down any target he chooses.
But wait, there's more! Sun God's Majesty also provides a 3-turn Luster Candy at the start of battle, aiding you in winning the buff war. With Panel 2 unlocked, it further chains into a 3-turn Debilitate, literally swinging every buff by himself for free.
To cap it off, Sun God's Majesty gives him +20% Max HP if fully levelled. Paired with his passable VIT-stat and innate Fire Survivor, this makes him surprisingly bulky, especially if Epitome of Endurance is transferred.
He can be left at Lv 1 for even more speed control, since Sun God's Majesty deals fixed damage regardless of his level. This in turn allows him to run Teal for Null Ice instead, letting him cover his weakness.","
Weak to Ice unless Teal.
High AGI makes him awkward to fit into slow teams, more or less mandating Epitome of Endurance.","
Remember when we thought Warlord's Wrath was overloaded? Sun God's Majesty literally exceeds Twitter's character limit."
"Alice","PT","PT","4","3","3","5","5","
Die for Me! inflicts Mortal (instant kill) and bypasses Endure-type skills, making her incredibly valuable in deleting key demons for PvP.
High MAG stat combined with Dark Amp in Purple makes her a very powerful Dark Mage.
Incredible panels that give her damage amplification, MP cost reduction and increased uses of her signature unique skill.
She's cute!!","
Needs Dark Pierce (weak) and Panel 3 to really shine.
Needs to run Divines without Panel 2 for first turn Die for Me! and to mitigate long term MP issues.
Weak to Light and by extension the Archangels matchup. Teal fixes this somewhat but you lose Dark Amp in return.","
She has pretty bad AI (will sometimes Mamudoon instead of spamming DFM), keep this in mind when using her for Defense.
Mortal is lot less powerful against Xi Wangmu teams, as she will simply resurrect the Mortal-ed target and is immune to Mortal herself."
"Alice A","T","PT","5","4","4","1","2","
One of only two demons in the game with an AOE Mortal, and the only one who can cast it T1. When paired with curse support like Nebiros, she can easily decimate entire teams without Null Curse and/or Null Mortal.
Drains 1 MP from the enemy at the start of their turn, which stops MANY T1 sweepers (eg Baal, Anat, Uriel) in their tracks.
Trivializes almost all PvE content like Aura Gate and Hell's Park - pair her with an AOE curse inflictor and instakill everyone!
Purple gains Null Mortal which prevents her from being killed by other Mortal users.
She's cute!!","
Hard countered by Null Curse and Null Mortal.
Weak to Light and by extension the Archangels matchup. Teal fixes this somewhat but you lose Null Mortal in return.","
Cannot be used in the same team with OG Alice."
"Alilat","C","C","4","2","2","1","1","
While alive, Repel Pierce will prevent Pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Very high Luck stat allows her to be used as both an Ailment inflictor and a cleanser (especially with innate Infernal Mask and P1).
Good HP and VIT stats and no weaknesses give her a lot of bulk.
Very cheap to fuse.","
Megidola is a wasted skill as her Magic stat is low.","
One of the few demons that can negate Pierce, and the only fusible one. A near Must-Have demon for PvE, as Repel Pierce paired with appropriate demons is perfect for cheesing most Boss fights."
"Amaterasu","Y","C","2","2","2","3","3","
Tenson Kourin is a powerful buff that removes debuffs then gives your team a 6 turn Luster Candy
Mediarahan in yellow costs only 8, letting her cast it every other turn with Divine brands.","
Maragion is a waste in support builds
Her MP costs are absurdly high and completely outclassed by Barong
Has elec weakness, making her even more of a liability in pve
Healing isn't particualrly valuable in PvP, and her high costs make her nigh worthless there.
Absolute garbage panels.","
How the mighty have fallen. If any launch player could imagine saying 'Just make Barong, Amaterasu is useless' you'd be told you're crazy."
"Anahita","PR","PY","4","4","4","5","5","
Reasonably fast, with 202 agi and Ice Accele, along with 20% more speed in P1, helping cement her role as a T1 magic nuker.
Has extremely endure piercing high ST ice damage in Hell Stream, which additionally gives her team some buff control if the attack is successful.
Aqua Grace not only gives her team a turn of 400HP Bulwark, but also gives anybody with a bulwark 30% magic damage boost, letting her team do massive magic damage, extremely useful for democalypse.
Solar Downfall in yellow and Ice Amp in purple both work well with her role as a fast damage dealer.
BoS Avarice is made for her, with her cheap, massive single target ice damage.
Has strong synergy with on the rise magic T1 teams with Elohim, Nyarlathotep, Vishnu A, and Mithras.","
She's a fast demon with a bulwark, which is really a role mismatch. A 400 hp bulwark isn't keeping a fast team alive.
For her to do her best in democ, she needs to have P2, because she only has a bulwark for 1 turn without it, meaning her team won't take full advantage of her damage boost.
She's not super fast, meaning she'll lower your speed compared to some of the faster demons.","-"
"Ananta","R","P","2","2","3","3","1","
He casts all 3 Buffs at the start of every player turn and enemy turn, offering consistent buff control at no MP cost.
Panel 4 also casts debilitate at the start of the enemy turn, or when your team casts a healing skill.
Mabufudyne in Red plus Infinite Chakra helps him pull his weight beyond just being a buffbot in Ice Democalypse prelim.
Works well in slow double Intimidating Stance teams, and can be deliberately left at level 1 to lower battle speed if used as a pure buff bot.
Even though he auto-casts all buffs at the start of your turn, Auto-Taruka in purple for pvp is still his best. Because of the timing of Endless One, Auto-Taruka can function mainly to counter the enemy Auto-Tarunda to ensure you get the attack buff from Endless One at the start of your turn.","
Weak to Force.
Mag is only average and he has no innate pierce, so even if Red he's still more of a support than a sweeper.
Newer demons have buff chains on their skills, which may reduce Ananta's niche.","-"
"Anat","P","PC","4","3","3","5","3","
Thunderstorm deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Tarunda. This is further augmented by innate Elec Amp, making her a terrifying Elec sweeper.
Killer Impulse lets her function as an Endure breaker, and has great synergy with Hresvelgr.
Merciless Blow in purple is incredible for Elec Democalypse.","
Weak to Force.
Panel 2 is Mandatory for Turn 1 Thunderstorm.
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only Thunderstorm and Killer Impulse have Pierce.","
Red gives her discounted Thunder Reign which can be used against Elec Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Mother Harlot. Note that it does not pierce though!
Killer Impulse can be denied by having Endure on all demons. This is becoming more commonplace after the introduction of Survivor skills.
As her main use in PVP is spamming Thunderstorm and Elec weakness is rarely left open due to Atropos, Clear is her only archetype that can reliably increase damage, albeit by a very small amount. However, building a Clear one locks you out of Archetype switching, and significantly reduces her damage in Democalypse, so weigh your options wisely."
"Angra Mainyu","TR","PT","3","3","3","1","1","
Everything Evil is an incredibly powerful passive that gives your whole team 2 MP at the beginning of the turn. Not only does this counter the MP Drain from Alice A's Give me Jewels, it also allows your team to run Spell/War brands instead of Divine for more damage.
16 Scourges chips off 25% of Max HP from the opposing team and inflicts them with every single ailment in the game. The chip damage helps your main sweeper to clean up, while the Ailments can be used to set up for demons like Alice A and Pale Rider.
When used with Atavaka or Alilat, innate Repel Elec helps to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.
Thanks to his High Luck and Infernal Mask in Purple, he can be run as a Pseudo Cleric if Prayer is transferred (preferably with another Ailment Resist passive like Epitome of Illusion).
Panel 2 provides a single turn Luster Candy in addition to the 2 MP, making it even easier for your team to sweep.","
Weak to Light.
Not very useful for PvE as his passive has limited uses, and Ailments generally fall flat late game due to inflated enemy stats.
Has a very expensive banner, requiring 27,500 gems for a guaranteed copy.
He doesn't have any form of Barrier Break in his kit, meaning someone else with it has to go before him, or else his ailments won't stick.
16 Scourges deals fractional damage, which doesn't scale from MATK, meaning that his high Magic stat is wasted without transferred skills.","
Be very wary of any enemy Daisoujou, as he will respond with a Mute Counter the moment you fire off 16 Scourges. This can severely mess you up if your sweepers end up getting Muted.
As Angra Mainyu is a Tyrant, he can be run in Lucifuge teams. Red in particular gives him access to discounted Megidolaon, which is further discounted thanks to Hell's Ministry and Lucifuge's Panel 1. In return, the ailments from 16 Scourges allow Lucifer to run double Deadly skills (like Deadly Poison and Deadly Mute), which will greatly amplify Morning Star's damage."
"Aniel","P","P","4","2","2","2","5","
Glorious Bolt restores 1 MP to the whole party (including himself) and costs a measly 5 MP to activate.
Innate Thunderclap and Light Enhancement in Purple make him a powerful nuker for Light Democalypse.
Panel 3 unlocks a damage aura for your other Archangels, further elevating the damage ceiling of that team composition.
When used with Atavaka or Alilat, innate Repel Elec helps to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.","
As Archangels are mostly used as Glass Cannon teams, God's Grace is irrelevant most of the time (outside of the passive damage boost).
Angra Mainyu pretty much does his job without eating a Press Turn.","
The MP restoration aspect is very powerful to counter Alice A's passive MP Drain. This is most notable on an Archangels compositions, who previously had to run suboptimal techs like Lakshmi A to avoid being crippled by Give me Jewels. Even outside Archangels, he can function as an offensive MP Battery to give T1 teams even more muscle."
"Ardha","PT","T","4","3","3","1","5","
Sahasrara is an incredibly stacked passive that provides additional MP regen, damage, hit rate and healing effectiveness.
Ruin and Grace is a very hard-hitting ST skill that has a high critical rate and heals your whole party if it hits. Combined with high natural MAG and innate Epitome of Carnage, Ardha can deal massive damage while keeping your party healthy.
Naturally drains Fire and Elec while gaining Drain Phys in Teal. This makes Ardha an incredible partner for Demiurge, especially to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.
Can be used in Phys Democalypse as a powerful boss unit, especially in Purple for Merciless Blow.","
Ruin and Grace does not bypass Endures.","
Run Ardha with Lakshmi A to give your whole team near unlimited MP."
"Arioch","PTY","","3","5","5","5","3","
Has a huge hp barrier on the first turn, making it a challenge for T1 teams to kill him, especially when paired with revivers like Xi Wangmu or Maria
Perfect for T2 teams, with Intimidating Stance, incredibly low agi, and innate Epitome of Endurance.
His abilities scale off of max HP, allowing him to do huge amounts of damage based off his hp.
At the end of the opponents first turn, he enters a state of Charge and Rebellion, meaning his next hit will hit like a truck, and he additionally chips at their Max hp
Both of his unique attacks go through endures, making it easier for him to sweep with Lionfall.
His panels are great, making him even harder to kill and giving him much needed accuracy.
Red has both ST and AoE making it easier for him to avoid anti pierce.","
64 agi is nice for going slow, but it means he's also completely blind. Needs a ton of accuracy and buff control to hit evasive targets, especially with evasion popular in the current meta
Lionfall does not have mp reduction in levels, and this can be abused by players using mp drain like Mind Break.
High hp totals mean fractional damage skills are going to hit harder on him.
Has some ai issues when anti-pierce comes into play, which can lead to him wasting his Charge and Rebellion combo on an auto attack","-"
"Asherah","PT","TY","3","4","3","2","2","
Mother's Creation revives a unit with full HP while also generating a Press Turn, allowing the resurrected unit to act immediately.
Silent Prayer in Yellow allows her to act as a Pseudo-Cleric and also removes Barrier, Tetraja, Charge etc.
Innate Mediarama and Recovery Amp in Purple lets her function as a decent PvE Healer.
Functions well in a Moirai Sisters team, as she can fulfill the Lady/Femme requirements while still providing massive utility.","
Weak to Ice and Dark, both very common attacking elements.
Low AGI means she will need Lead Brands or even slower teammates to work as a Cleric.
Requires Panel 4 to make her a reliable tank in today's meta.","
Very powerful against Archangel Teams, as her sheer bulk and Fire damage reduction from Panel 2 ensures she can stay alive and turn the tables through Mother's Creation.
Beware revive sealing units who can render Mother's Creation useless."
"Astaroth","","PTR","4","5","5","5","5","
Demons die when they are killed by Lord Astaroth, letting him be a hard counter to revive teams that don't have Maria
When enemies die, he offers incredible buff control, swinging every offensive buff and debuff in his team's favor. In addition to this, the first time an enemy dies, he gives his team a press turn, allowing up to 6 press turns when paired with Masakado A
Lord Astaroth has absurd damage, doing 250 damage total with bonus crit rate. The second hit can also be used to check evasive targets without risking press turns. It also only costs 5 mp base, and is reduced to 4 mp with his first panel, meaning when paired with Maria, he can use it every turn even with war brands.
With the second highest agi in the game, and 70% battle speed built into his kit with 20% more in panels, he's going to make your teams fast.
Does so much damage he doesn't just need to be in fast teams. He also functions great in midrange teams, especially when paired with Maria.
An absolutely absurd 100% crit rate built right into his kit, meaning unless he's against Epitome of Fortitude or Wild Instinct, he's essentially guaranteed to crit.
Amazing panels, with the aforementioned mp reduction in p1, a huge party crit rate and hit rate buff in p2, and even more speed and damage in p3
Amazing awaken skills, offering aoe mp drain, buff control, damage, or Repel Phys, depending on what you need
Completely redefined the pvp meta. He hits so hard that if you don't have a way to deal with his damage, you will struggle to climb.","
Red awaken skill, Cleaving Aura, is one of the best mp drain skills in the game, but the ai will attack into ndr, limiting its power on pvp defense teams.
T1 teams built with him have to choose between speed, or being able to deal with the bulk of Maria teams, meaning randoming can be risky
Constantly chains effects, slowing down pve clear times
No innate Mara","-"
"Asura","R","T","4","1","1","4","5","
High STR and Ashura are devastating against lone targets like Bosses. This makes him a very strong Phys Democalypse unit.
Three Faces Six Arms and his good innate bulk are the perfect counter to skills like Fire of Sinai and Griffon-Bolt.
Mana Aid is fantastic for PvE farming as it lets him spam Ashura.
Single-handedly trivializes Brands of Sin Deceit 11.
Repel Phys in Teal and high VIT make him a good partner for Alilat and Atavaka.","
Weak to Ice.
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.","
His only Piercing attack being Random Target makes him near unusable in PvP. Using Ashura against Masakado means your death."
"Asura Lord","PR","PT","5","2","2","5","3","
Incredibly high ST damage that also generates Press Turns thanks to his high Crit Rate.
Passively increases your team's Crit Rate and Crit Damage through Endless War. Pairs very well with Kartikeya, as their combined passives will give your team a whopping +40% boost to Crit Rate.
Slaughter All can only be blocked by two demons (Beelzebub (Human) and Griffith) and ignores Endure-type skills, allowing you to delete any demon he claps. It is also very useful to clean up any remaining enemies (usually bosses) after your AOE demons have unleashed their payload, notably D11 Metatron.
Red gives him a powerful AOE in Gigantomachia. Combined with his innate Great Aim and Pierce in Endless War, this makes him a terrifying sweeper.
Good repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat or Atavaka. Fire and Light repel is especially useful to counter Archangel teams, as it makes him immune to both their AOE elements.","
Hard to raise Slaughter All's damage further as it is of the Almighty element.
High MP cost mandates the use of Divine Brands if Panel 2 is not unlocked, which can slightly reduce his damage potential.
Middling AGI makes him slightly awkward to fit in fast or slow teams.","
Fits well in Hero Masakado T1 Defense Teams, especially if Auto-Rebellion is transferred.
Red also helps against Beelzebub (Human), as it gives Asura Lord a way to keep doing significant damage despite Lord of the Dead's barrier. Beware of Anti-Pierce, though!"
"Atavaka","PT","P","4","5","5","1","1","
While alive, War Aid will prevent Pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Intimidating Stance is a very powerful passive for PvP and synergizes with his low AGI.
Enemy Annihilation fully debuffs enemies before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if it misses and/or hits into Phys NDR+Anti-Pierce, allowing him to spam it without concern.","
Weak to Ice.
Very high MP costs. Running Divine sets hurt his overall damage and/or Bulk.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","
One of only three demons that can negate Pierce. He is also the only one with Intimidating Stance."
"Atropos","P","PR","2","3","3","3","3","
Passionate Rage dishes out massive damage before the battle even really begins. Since it triggers at the start of the opponent turn, she can easily kill frail Turn 1 Sweepers, especially if combined with the buff swing from Lachesis' Passionate Embrace.
Severed Fate deals Piercing Single Target damage and will automatically target Fire, Ice, Elec or Force weaknesses. Combined with innate Merciless Blow, she can heavily punish any demons who leave a weakness open.
Purple gives her Infinite Chakra, allowing her to spam Severed Fate repeatedly even while on Spell Brands. Red gives her access to discounted Judgement, useful if you want an AOE to compliment her passive chains.
Her Panels provide valuable ailment immunity, making it harder for Ailment Teams to sweep her on revenge.","
If the first Elec part of Passionate Rage is Anti-Pierced (for example Rama-Mother Harlot, Atavaka-Aniel), the second Fire part will not proc, literally halving her damage.
Requires a good team built around her to work.
Awkward mix of 4 Elements plus having both ST and AOE skills makes it difficult to boost her damage outside Elemental Cycle.
As Press Turns are calculated based on the number of demons alive at the start of the turn, any demons who survive Passionate Rage will gain access to multiple Press turns. Several demons like Guts and Anat can abuse this to reverse sweep instead.","
Tzitzimitl bears special mention here. If she can survive Passionate Rage, she will gain immediate access to Disastrous Eclipse and Star of Darkness, letting her fire off hard-hitting AOE Revive Seals."
"Azazel","T","PT","2","2","2","4","3","
The only demon in the game with access to two innate Endures in Purple. He can stack up to 4 Endures as a result, giving him immense survivability as long as it is not bypassed.
Fallen Grigori provides him HP and MP sustain every turn (as long as he is below the 80% threshold). Combined with his Endure stacks, this can make him very difficult to kill.
Guillotine Blaze is a low MP single target Fire Nuke that pierces, ignores Endures and has high crit rate. This is further augmented by innate Fire Amp and constant Rebellion from Fallen Grigori.
Panel 2 fire off a free Guillotine Blaze every turn, letting him deal extra damage without consuming MP.","
Weak to Elec, which is currently a very bad weakness to have thanks to Atropos.
Damage is lackluster in Fire Democalypse Boss Phase, as the Boss has +100% Crit Resist.
Only Guillotine Blaze has Pierce.
Several skills like Baptisma and Dragon Slayer completely ignore Endures, negating a huge portion of his kit. This also applies to skills with Mortal effect.","
Red provides him discounted Maragidyne, giving him access to an AoE skill for PvE and/or Democalypse. Note that it will not pierce though!"

Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.

"Ban","","","4","2","2","4","4","
Drains MP from the enemy team at the start of his turn, allowing him to keep his MP topped off and control enemy mp
Good single target piercing physical damage in Physical Hunt, which also drains 3 mp, allowing him to drain potentially 7 mp from a target in a single turn, or four from two.
Decent bulk with a good vit stat, innate Epitome of Fortitude, along with additional hp% from panels, and a built in endure with hp% in levels, combined with null mortal, can keep him alive draining MP
Offers some buff control with p2
Flexible with his colors, with each color offering different uses, letting him flex into many different teams.","
Because he drains mp at the start of his turn, he won't steal mp from a T1 team, potentially letting him get swept in a single turn.
His agi is too high for a slow team, but slow for a fast team, making him hard to slot into pvp teams.
While far from weak, his damage is low compared to the highest tier of damage dealers, and the mp drain doesn't really counteract that enough to warrant a slot in a team.
Has decent bulk and decent damage, but isn't exceptional enough at either of them to excel at anything.","
Only gains phys pierce in p1, meaning his auto attacks or Vorpal Blade in red are a liability without his panels
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Barong","T","","4","1","1","3","3","
Barong Dance provides a decent AOE heal while giving the party a full Luster Candy buff. It also has infinite uses and can be reduced to a mere 5 MP when maxed with Panel 1 unlocked.
Very high AGI allows him to be used as a fast support, especially with Speedster transferred for Battle Speed requirements.
Can be used as a buffer for Elec Democalypse thanks to Barong Dance having high cast priority.","
Weak to Force and Dark.
Low MAG stat means he won't heal for much.
Elec attack spells (and Elec Amp in Purple) are wasted slots considering his bad Magic stat.","
Niche use in Aura Gate as giving him Support AI with his MATK low enough guarantees he'll heal you with Barong Dance no matter your HP. This is useful to recover HP lost from Talk and/or enemy encounters."
"Batou","P","P","2","2","2","2","5","
Tachikoma Support gives him a whopping +75% Battle Speed and autocasts a two-turn Rakunda + Sukunda when going first, making him very useful for Fast Teams.
Against single targets, SEBURO C-40A deals massive damage, totalling up to 320 Base Power - this is even higher than Hassou Tobi (280 BP) and Ashura (300 BP), and is further augmented by Death Blow in Purple.
Due to being coded as a conditional 'when attacking first' skill (like Solars), Tachikoma Support will activate even during the Boss Phase in Democalypse. Combined with SEBURO C-40A's high base power, this makes him very useful for Phys Democalypse - provided you transfer another Single Target attack to use once he runs out of Seburo charges.
Panel 2 provides an additional Seburo charge and gives him additional accuracy + crit rate, very useful (and borderline mandatory) if going for a Democalypse boss build.
His middling AGI is both a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, having low AGI lets him go last in terms of turn order, where you can fully utilize SEBURO C-40A against softened / less targets. On the flip side however...","
... Low base AGI means he won't be able to fully take advantage of the +75% Battle Speed from Tachikoma Support, roughly making him the equivalent of an uninvested P0 Garuda in terms of Battle Speed contribution.
Epitome of Fortitude is a laughably wasted skill on a Turn 1 unit.","
If using for Democalypse, be aware that his AI will refuse to use Luster Candy on Turn 1, even with Support AI and massive VIT investment. This is likely due to [SEBURO C-40A]]'s insane base power affecting the AI's decision-making.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Bayonetta â˜†","P","","2","1","1","1","2","
Madama Stomp levels and Savage Glee in Purple give her enormous crit rates.
Madama Stomp autocasts an Almighty attack that also charms whenever she lands a crit. Deals decent damage after being buffed to scale off her PATK.
Gomorrah (B) has high base damage and crit chance, letting you delete an enemy and charm the rest of the team.","
Highly dependant on having Panel 2 unlocked for Phys Pierce.
Gomorrah (B) takes two turns to charge, and is difficult to build due to it scaling off both PATK and MATK.
Mediocre overall stats, bad bulk.
Same problem Jeanneâ˜† has. Gets completely outclassed even by fusable phys attackers like Fafnir, let alone other gacha only phys attackers, something that particularly sucks considering how rare of a unit she is.","
No longer memeÂ :(
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Beelzebub (Human)","P","PY","2","5","5","1","1","
Lord of the Dead autocasts Almighty Tetrakarn and Rakukaja every turn. This is incredibly useful to counter Almighty Physical attackers like Shiva A and Skull Knight.
With Panel 2 unlocked, Lord of the Dead also reduces Piercing Physical damage as long as the barrier is up. This pretty much gives the team a 30% damage reduction from Physical Pierce, as most of them cannot remove Tetrakarn. This also applies to Elemental Physical attackers like Koga Saburo.
Great Chaos deals piercing Dark damage to a single target which also Mutes them, before chaining into an AOE piercing Elec attack that binds whoever it hits. This provides him great ailment control, especially if Panel 1 is unlocked to provide the team a free Barrier Break.
Has good bulk thanks to decent VIT/HP stats and Lord of the Dead providing him a 500-HP Endure.
Purple gains Intimidating Stance which synergizes well with his low AGI.","
His damage output is rather low, as nothing in his kit boosts it (outside of Panel 3) and his MAG stat is fairly average for a mage.
This is made worse by his kit having a combination of ST, AOE, Dark and Elec elements, making it even harder to augment his damage.
Heavily reliant on Panel 1 and 2 to shine, otherwise he is rather mediocre.
Beelzebub (Human) is a silly name.","
Cannot be used in the same team with Beelzebubâ˜† and the regular 4â˜… Beelzebub."
"Beelzebub â˜†","","PT","5","5","5","4","5","
Death Flyers deals Almighty AOE damage and ignores Endures. This makes him incredibly powerful for cleanup, especially after a big nuke like Morning Star or Third Eye. On top of that, it grows stronger with each passing turn, gaining increased damage on Turn 2 and AOE Mortal on Turn 3.
When going first, King of Hell provides him 3 MP and a free Offensive Cry debuff. If paired with Angra Mainyu, this effectively gives him FULL MP on Turn 1, paving the way for absurd combos like Concentrate into Death Flyers.
When going second, King of Hell acts as Intimidating Stance while providing the team a Defensive Cry buff, greatly increasing the team's survivability.
As if that wasn't enough, King of Hell also gives him an 800-HP Endure. Factoring in the healing from Panel 1, an Almighty Survivor transfer and his good defensive stats, Beelzebubâ˜† is one hard bug to squash.
Panel 2 provides him immunity to Charm, Bind and Mute, allowing him to be run as a Cleric if Prayer is transferred.
Purple gains Null Mortal which prevents him from being killed by other Mortal users. Teal gains access to Drain Phys, which can be useful for pairing with Demiurge.
The auto-Offensive Cry from King of Hell lasts 3 turns and triggers in both phases of Democalypse, making him a very powerful tech unit there.","
Middling AGI makes him awkward to slot in slow teams. Consider an Epitome of Endurance transfer if you want to do so.
As his kit is entirely Almighty, Five Elements counters him pretty hard. Pairing him with a Demiurge with Panel 2 unlocked offsets this weakness though.
Heavily reliant on Panel 1 and 2 to shine, otherwise he is fairly easy to deal with.","

"Belial","P","P","3","2","2","5","2","
Flames of Gomorrah is a hard hitting Fire (Physical) skill that pierces, crits and can be cast T1 even with War brands. Fire Amp in Purple makes it even deadlier.
Sins of Sodom provides Fast-Debilitate if an enemy is cursed, which pairs perfectly with the 80% curse-rate of Flames of Gomorrah, or with Nebiros who can curse before your turn.
Panel 2 allows him to Crit indefinitely.","
Weak to Ice.
Lack of ST skills gives him trouble with Fire Anti-Pierce like Atavaka-Vairocana or Rama-Surt.","
Many PvE enemies including certain Bosses are not immune to curse, making him an insane Debuffer for PvE."
"Berserker Guts","PR","P","3","3","3","5","3","
Berserk is the hardest-hitting ST skill in the game right now, sporting a massive combined 300 BP with sky-high Crit Rate, which also ignores any Endure skill. In addition, if the first part of the skill manages to kill the target, the chain effect will go off on a separate demon, effectively letting you clean up two demons in one go.
High AGI and STR, coupled with his massive damage output, makes him a perfect fit for fast T1 teams, especially if paired with Masakado A, Angra Mainyu etc.
Gains access to the rare Death Blow in Purple, further increasing his damage. Red gives him access to discounted Binge Eating which helps to offset the fixed damage from Berserker Armor.","
Berserk only has two charges. This makes missing particularly painful for him.
Berserker Armor takes off 40% of his Max HP and the end of the opponent's turn, effectively turning him into a ticking time bomb.","
Berserker Armor reduces ALL damage he takes by 40%. As damage reduction stacks additively, it is possible to reach over 100% AOE Reduction if combined with demons like Orcus + Slime and take literally zero damage (outside of Fractional damage).
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun.
Due to how powerful crits are in Phys Democalypse, he is a fantastic Prelim sweeper due to Berserker Armor's high crit boost, provided you transfer an AOE like Gigantomachia."

High Magic stat and innate Pierce on Go to Hell! makes him a good magic sweeper.
Curse of Anguish and Panels pair well with Yama, who automatically curses everyone at the start of the Boss wave.
Go to Hell! has a high Curse chance, which lets him setup for other curse-based sweepers like Alice A.
Yellow gains access to Concentrate to further increase his sweeping potential.
Innate Mabufudyne and Ice Amp in Purple lets him function as an excellent Ice Sweeper too, especially for Democalypse.","
Weak to Light.
Go to Hell! has low base power and does not gain damage on level up.

Black Beckoning grows stronger with every passing turn, culminating in a massive Fractional damage nuke on turn 4.
Black Lullaby provides an AOE Heal while Muting all enemies. This further chains into a Rakukaja + Sukukaja buff with Panel 2 unlocked.
High Luck helps her with landing ailments and run a Dodge Tank build relatively well, especially if you have access to Panel 1 and/or Epitome of Madness.","
Weak to Force.
Black Beckoning has a low damage cap (3400 Max Damage combined). As a result, she will have trouble killing bulky units without additional damage support.
Black Beckoning boost level only increases if she is alive at the start of your turn. By repeatedly killing her, you can delay the Fractional nuke indefinitely.
Black Beckoning has a usage cap of 1 - once the max boost level nuke is fired, it will simply stop functioning for the rest of the battle.","
Has decent synergy in a Moirai Sister team - she fulfills their skill requirements, being of the Lady race, and the constant passive damage from Atropos brings targets down to Black Beckoning kill range. She will also benefit from any ailment immunity Panel they have."

Soul Divide punishes healing by dealing Fractional damage based on the enemy's current health. Useful in Brands of Sin Vanity stages where healing is abundant.
Soul Divide also punishes passive healing such as Erlkonig's Alder King, Hecate's Lunar Awakening and Beelzebubâ˜†'s Panel 1.
Famine deals fractional damage to all enemies and depletes 2 MP at the end of their turn. Pairs well with Alice A for a devastating MP denial combination.
Decent Magic stat and good Panels can make him a strong Ice mage.","
Weak to Fire.
Soul Divide damage is based on Current Health and cannot kill targets.
High AGI makes him awkward to slot in slow teams, despite the great synergy with Alice A.","
The Baphomet Prelim in Light Democalypse will occasionally cast Drain, triggering Soul Divide for massive damage. It is a rather unreliable tech though, especially if you have demons that NDR Dark in the same team."
"Cerberus A","PYR","PY","4","4","4","3","5","
Is the only unit in the game with a skill that gains back a press turn lost to Intimidating Stance, giving him a unique niche on faster teams, and also giving him buff control, reducing their atk/def. Additionally, if this skill procs, he will enter a state of charge, allowing him to do massive damage with his first cast of Hell Blaze
As Hell Blaze ramps up, it begins to rival the sheer numbers that Koga Saburo's Soaring Blades can put out, for less mp at p2
Pierce in Phys along with his Hell Blaze piercing allows flexibility in avoiding NDR.
Looks badass as hell","
Is not the fastest demon in the game, meaning he's not always the best candidate for T1 teams, as if he's outsped, he'll near certainly lose.
While the flexibility of two element pierce is nice, it's difficult to raise the damage of two separate elements
With high hit counts and no hit rate boosts outside p1 and his purple awaken skill, his accuracy can be a liability
His str and agi both are good, but not spectacular, leading to him being outclassed by his competition in terms of damage and speed

Life & Death randomly revives an ally demon whenever an enemy dies. It is one of the few revive spells with no usage limit, and is useful to keep momentum swinging in your favor, particularly with Panel 2 unlocked giving you a Rakukaja and Tarukaja chain.

Innate Enduring Soul + is useful to let him last around longer.","
Weak to Force.

Life & Death combos very well with Ixtab's Yaxche, as it will bring her back to life after Yaxche procs, allowing her to Mortal yet another demon.
Life & Death will also trigger off enemy self kills, such as Berserker Armor and Recarmdra."

Omen of Rebellion is one of the most loaded skills in the game, and his defining trait. Phys Pierce, 50% acc, 50% phys damage, 40% incoming aoe damage reduction, on top of 40% more universal damage reduction when he's in a state of Charge, and a chain that activates any time an ally dies, as well as at the end of his turn, dealing 4x20BP aoe to the enemy team, and granting Charge after the effect. This effect devastates T1 teams, nearly guaranteeing a wipe if two teammates die separately before he is killed, and additionally does great damage to tankier T2 or Midrange teams.
Arms Dance debuffs the enemy defense and ev/ac, and then does 200BP phys damage to a single target as a chain, meaning if any hit does manage to miss, despite your innate 85% acc, you don't lose press turns.
Zealous Rebel, which is his teal Gacha skill, is the perfect skill for him, helping him fight against other Chi Yous, while giving him more HP.
Solid panels which give him damage, buff control, HP, and even more accuracy.
Has innate Force Repel, helping him fight against demons like Sabaoth and Nyarlathotep, along with Repel Fire in teal, letting him be a powerful demon against Elohim when paired with Demiurge or even Atavaka.
Combined with Shaddai, really punishes T1 teams that rely on crit passing and Elohim's high AoE damage.
Has incredible staying power with his innate repels and high damage reduction when in a state of Charge.
Does incredibly high amounts of damage in Phys Democ when paired with Zaou-Gongen and Futsunushi to get around his crit penalty.","
Weak to Force.
Both Arms Dance and Omen of Rebellion hit 4x without preventing counters. Many players will use transfers like Faithful Counter, Zealous Rebel, and even Death Counter in a pinch to counter Chi You. Due to chain effect timing, he won't have his Charge damage reduction, and as they're single target attacks, he won't have his aoe damage reduction either.
Has only fairly average stats. It's not always easy to make him do a ton of damage while also being able to survive long enough to proc his chains.","-"

A powerful (but not mandatory) addition to the Moirai Sisters archetype, as Woven Fate is a 6 times use AOE Heal that also randomly revives one of your fallen teammates. Not only does this allow you to constantly revive Atropos, but it also ensures that all of the Sisters' chain effects can go off.
When combined with two other Lady or Femme demons (preferably her two other sisters), Passionate Allure charms all enemies at the end of her turn. This forces teams to constantly waste turns curing Charm, while Passionate Rage constantly chips at them.
Has arguably the best Panels for ailment immunity. Panel 1 prevents the team from being swept by Alice A, while Panel 2 makes them immune to Charm in the events of a mirror match.
High Luck helps her with landing ailments and run a Dodge Tank build relatively well, especially if you have access to Epitome of Madness.","
Passionate Allure's Auto-Charm can be punished by Daisoujou on the opposing team. This point is moot if you have Panel 2 Atropos, which makes your team immune to Mute.
Requires a good team built around her to work.
Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.","
As it is classified as a Recovery skill, the AI will spam Woven Fate to heal HP even if there are no downed demons, wasting the charges.
Highly reliant on having Panels to do well, as she faces stiff competition from other Lady / Femme demons like Xi Wangmu and Asherah for the slot in Moirai Sister teams."

Disgustingly flexible, with Call of R'lyeh offering TWO Intimidating Stance turn removals if he goes second, reducing enemy MP if he goes first along with chip damage, gives him Null Mortal, inflicts Gloom on the opponent at the start of their every turn, and offers a 30% damage boost to enemies afflicted by Gloom
As if that weren't enough MP drain, Lost Sanity accuractely describes the sanity of the devs at this point, being Megidolaon, an improved Mahamarin Karinon and Mahashibabooon, and a 2 MP removal all in one. Did I mention that instead of 8 mp cost like Megidolaon, it costs 5 mp at max level?
In theme with his kit, Suk Flexi offers different effects depending on whether or not he goes first, furthering his role as a midrange monster, and helping in the current meta where evasion can be king.
Panels increase his tankiness and almighty damage, while also offering additional buff control and Null Bind, so his chain effect to apply Gloom will always activate.
Has a great stat spread, with high Magic, Luck, Vitality, and middling Agi, which suits him perfectly as his kit doesn't care if he goes first or second.
Has innate Almighty Survivor for additional survivability and damage, because at this point what else does he need?
Oh, that's right, to match Nyarlathotep, he has four drain effects, giving him incredible anti-pierce capacity.","
If he goes first, he won't have Gloom on the opponents without Nyarlathotep on your first turn, which is worth considering.
Suk Flexi is a skill name so terrible it gives Great Idea or the Slowda skills a run for their money.
He does suffer slightly from being a bit of an all rounder, in that he's too fast for a dedicated slow team, while not offering enough to run in a dedicated fast team, as even his mp drain in that case probably won't be enough to keep a T1 team alive if they fail to sweep.
Not particularly special in PvE where enemies have unlimited MP, and Charm and Bind are virtually impossible to land on high level enemies.","-"

Very flexible kit. He can be either a physical or force demon. Innate Savage Glee paired with Panel 4, Gae Bolg hits hard (especially after Panel 1), making him an acceptable option for Phys Democalypse or even pvp.","
High MP costs, cannot Mazandyne Turn 1 in PvP unless Panel 3.
As nothing in his kit boosts Force damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
No Single-Target attack means he will have trouble against Anti-Force-Pierce.","

Low AGI makes him useable in Intimidating Stance teams."

Barbed Spear deals three separate hits, allowing it to function as an Endure breaker.

Teal has Drain Phys to pair with Rama in Drain Teams, increasing his survivability.","
Needs to survive an entire round to make use of Auto-Charge.
Missing just one of Barbed Spear's 12 hits results in lost Press Turns.
As nothing in his kit boosts Force damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.","

High MAG stat, Magna Mater, Merciless Blow and innate Trisagion + Maragidyne make her an extremely good Fire caster.
Magna Mater provides a team-wide Fire damage boost, incredible for Democalypse.","

Expensive multi-fusion that requires clear Asherah.","

Preach makes him immune to all ailments and will punish enemy teams attempting to use Charm. Cleansing Shout is both an Ailment and Debuff Cleanser at the same time. These two skills have perfect synergy together and make him the best Cleric in the game, only on par with Mahamayuri.
Panel 3 further improves his role, as it removes all opponents' buffs after Cleansing Shout is cast.
Good balanced stats coupled with no weaknesses and a perfect base kit allows total freedom in builds: he can work as a bulky tank, evasion tank, healer and/or a revive support.
Purple comes with innate Enduring Soul, which makes him bulkier and synergyze well with Recarmdra as the Premium Skill.
Very useful for Brands of Sin: Sloth auto-runs.","
Is a hard support unit, relies on transfer skills to offer anything outside cleansing.
Soul Drain is a wasted slot, as it is MP expensive and doesn't add to Daisoujou's support build. It also wastes MP in auto, as the AI will cast it when no Ailments are currently active.
As he needs to constantly spam Cleansing Shout, Divine Brands or a Mana Aid transfer are mandatory for Sloth auto-farming, especially in Red.","
He is very good in the current Meta, both against Curse-focused Nebiros teams and Auto-Charm Clotho teams.
When he has access to offensive spells (in Red or through transfers) his AI will prioritize those over Cleansing Shout if they can hit enemy weak points. This does not occur if your team is Binded and/or Charmed.
Comparatively, Daisoujou is better as a pure support demon (no weaknesses, provides buff control, can focus purely on survivability/evasion, more flexible on transfers), while Mahamayuri offers more offensive pressure and better Press Turn economy. Pick whoever your team needs more."

Rapid Shot deals five hits and puts him in a state of Rebellion without consuming any MP. This can be useful versus MP Denial teams like Alice A.

Million Stab is a piercing multihit AOE skill, useful for breaking Endures. At max levels it also refunds 2 MP on cast, making it easier to spam in PvE.","
Low AGI and LUK affects his accuracy.
Missing just one of Rapid Shot's 5 hits results in lost Press Turns. The Rebellion Autocast will also not trigger if any shot misses.
Million Stab has high MP costs, making it difficult to use for PvP unless you pair him with Angra Mainyu.

He is essentially an entire Ailment Team neatly packaged into one demon. Not only does Bohemian-- err Bemusing Rhapsody remove Barriers, it also has a high chance of inflicting Charm and Curse, while only costing 5 MP to cast.
Deadly Melody autocasts two random buffs and debuffs every time ailments land, allowing you to repeatedly swing buffs in your favor especially when paired with other ailment demons like Lilith A and Angra Mainyu. This is very powerful with Panel 2 unlocked, as it gives your teammtes increased damage against Cursed and Charmed units.
Panel 3 reduces ailment cure rate by 25%. This is incredibly strong as it ensures Bind and Charm will always last a turn (as long as they don't have increased recovery).
Panels 1 and 3 give him increased Battle Speed, allowing him to act as a Speedster.
Innate Epitome of Madness and Insanity in Purple, combined with Bemusing Rhapsody's high ailment base chance means he is almost guaranteed to land his ailments, allowing you to forego ailment infliction for other brand stats like Speed instead.","
Panels are mandatory on him, without them he is a rather mediocre ailment unit.
Stiff competition from Motoko Kusanagi who is also pretty much a standalone (heh) ailment package on her own. In a vacuum, Bind and Mute are arguably more useful ailments, and Motoko has the advantage of being fully useable without Panels.
Hard-countered by Ailment immunity, most notably Daisoujou, Panelled Clotho and Panel 2 Beelzebubâ˜†.","
While Bind and Mute might be more powerful on their own, Charm and Curse have more abuseable combos, most notably Lilith A, Alice A and to a lesser extent Panel 3 OG Lilith."
"Demiurge","","PR","4","5","5","1","3","
The only demon in the game with access to both Drain Pierce and Repel Pierce, Demiurge makes it incredibly easy to outfit your team with Anti-Pierce coverage, shutting down most elemental AOEs.
To add insult to injury (or in this case more injury to injury), False God triggers an Almighty AOE counter upon a repel, which deals respectable damage thanks to his high MAG stat and boost to almighty damage. This makes him particularly useful versus demons like Atropos and Guan Yu who are rather forced into their AOE spells.
Supreme Creator provides a team-wide heal upon a drain, which can be useful if run in bulky sustain teams. It also passively reduces the MP cost of all his skills by 1 MP, giving you more flexibility in brands.
Null Mortal in Purple makes him the only Anti-Pierce demon in the game who is immune to Mortal effects.
Red grants him access to discounted Ars Magna, a powerful single target Almighty attack.","
Does nothing against Almighty and Fractional damage, both of which are extremely common in higher tiers of PvP.
Stiff competition from Atavaka, who not only has Repel Pierce but also the extremely useful Intimidating Stance passive in Purple.
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk/evasion; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.","
He can cast Invasion during the Democalypse Boss Phase, providing you a one-turn Offensive Cry. It only lasts one turn though, so he will need to repeatedly waste turns casting it, making it an average tech at best."

Desperate Hit deals damage to random enemies at the end of his turn. This is great for cleaning up lone surviving targets and/or breaking Endures.
Desperate Hit deals Almighty (Physical) damage, which can currently be negated only by Lord of the Dead and Hawk of Light.
Iron Judgement deals Piercing Physical damage with a high chance to Bind, helping him land Desperate Hit shots. Low MP cost also makes it possible to be cast twice per turn even with War Brands.","
Combination of ST, AOE, Phys and Almighty elements in his kit makes it difficult to further boost his damage.
Fairly mediocre stats.
Iron Judgement has unimpressive Base Power.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","
If you went first, Desperate Hit will trigger before opposing 'end of turn' chain effects (like those from Nebiros and/or Hecate), giving you one last chance to clean up before they kick in.
If Charge or Rebellion is activated before the end of the turn, the effect will carry over to Desperate Hit. It will consume the buff after the attack though!"

Freezing Gale deals Ice damage multiple times to all enemies. In addition to it being a pseudo Endure breaker, it also revive seals any enemy it downs, making her the first unconditional AOE Revive Sealer in the game.
Fecund Womb will randomly revive a dead ally with full HP at the end of an opponent's turn. It also gives her Null Bind, ensuring the skill will always pop off as long as she is alive.
Massive HP stats, combined with innate Epitome of Endurance and Null Mortal with Panel 1 make her very difficult to kill.
Butcher in purple helps to amplify her damage, while Teal gives her Repel Elec to cover her weakness.","

Innate ailment resistance in p1 helps her chain to cleanse the whole party as well as passively heal.
Lots of healing bonus along with decent magic stat means she's going to heal for a lot
Ark is a cheap almighty single target attack that revive seals, letting her contribute both offensively and defensively to the party, and mostly avoid ndr
Cleanses passively with Goddess Aid, meaning she doesn't take press turns from your bigger damage dealers","
Needs p1 to even remotely function, which is a tough ask of a collab unit.
Does not block charm, nor does she cleanse it, meaning to properly function as a cleanser, the entire team needs null charm, or she needs to use her transfers as Null Charm and Prayer, removing any build flexibility
Also does not block or cleanse curse, hurting her healing
Healing is not strong in this game, meaning she's mediocre at a job that isn't too good to begin with
Her damage simply isn't high enough with the escalating life totals in this game, and almighty damage is difficult to boost
She's split between offense and defense and fails miserably at both. Daisoujou, a choice file unit, does her job far better, as does Mahamayuri, who has had reruns, while collab reruns are few and far between

Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Elohim","","PY","5","5","5","5","5","
Solar Flare is a fire magic attack reminiscient of Dragon Blade, doing a strong ST hit and then an aoe follow up. However, both hits ignore endures, and this skill introduces the Remnants mechanic, meaning this skill will always only take half a press turn. No need to crit, no need to hit weakness, this skill will still take only half a press turn. Better yet, at P1 and max level, it costs 4 mp, making MP denial less effective as with Maria or divines, he will always be able to cast it.
Light of Elohim is just as loaded of a skill, offering him 35% magic damage, Fire Pierce, buff control every time he casts Solar Flare and at the start of battle, AND a free Maragidyne the first time a demon was killed each turn, except this Maragidyne also ignores endures.
With the third highest magic and third highest agi in the game, along with innate Fire Accele and 40% battle speed from panels, he's fast, and hits hard, meaning you need to take fewer sacrifices to keep a high battle speed and still kill tanky teams.
Every single awaken skill is unique to him, offering ST revive sealing almighty damage in red, immunity to mute charm and bind in yellow, 25% magic damage in purple, and drain light and dark in teal. Every single one of these skills has a situation where it's useful.
Has strong synergy with other demons with damaging chain effects, including even Atropos, where if she can kill a demon, he'll continue the carnage with Light of Elohim","
He is fragile, so if the enemy gets to act, he will near certainly be going down.
His high agi and battle speed contribution can make him troubling to slot into teams other than turn 1 fast teams.
If you do find yourself in a situation without MP to cast Solar Flare, being a magic attack based demon with no panels to transform his attack to elemental can be a liability.
While far from slow, a good chunk of his battle speed comes from panels, meaning an unpaneled Elohim can be a speed liability compared to the highest tiers of players/whales.
Remnants can be stopped by attacking into a unit with a fire weakness while the opponent has Orcus.","
While he is incredibly powerful in PvE content, he will slow down your clears due to all of his chain effects.
He has the exact same agility as Astaroth. Make sure you watch your party setup to manipulate the turn order in the desired manner. Often Elohim into Astaroth is a useful order to make use of Elohim's guaranteed half press turn usage."

Alder King heals your team on your turn, and debuffs the enemy's attack on their's. When paired with P3, this turns into a full defensive buff swing in your favor.
Has massive survivability thanks to Power of Life providing auto-Lydia, Alder King's healing, his massive HP and VIT stats (further boosted by skill levels and panels) and Null Mortal in Purple. His good bulk allows him to fully capitalize on Recarmdra, as he will usually be the last one standing.
Low AGI makes him perfect for bulky slow teams.","
Weak to Fire. This is particularly bad in a Surt A-heavy meta.
Maziodyne is a wasted slot.","
Due to Alder King's effect timing, it actually procs after most of the enemy's auto-skills have activated. When paired with demons that have similar timings (like Vairocana and Lachesis), it guarantees a full defensive buff swing regardless of what your opponent runs (Solar skills, Angra Mainyu's Panel 2, etc. all go off first, before getting wiped out)."

Hero of Prophecy grants Phys Pierce, puts his team into Zenith at the start of each turn, grants attack buff swing, and additionally grants 25% damage to physical skills and 30% acc to any allies in a state of Zenith. This massively buffs the power of any physical damage team.
Demonsbane also puts the team into a state of Zenith, and then chains a high damage aoe phys attack, all for 5 mp. Since the phys part is a chain effect, no press turns will be lost on miss or drain/repel, making it safe to use even against evasive enemies. Having two ways to grant Zenith really helps controlling statuses against enemies that use Gloom.
His awaken skills all have their own uses, depending on the situation.
Panels grant battle speed, buff control, and damage, along with a little bit of bulk, all things he needs to help his team sweep.","
180 agi and only 20% battle speed in panels is going to likely lower the battle speed of any fast team.
Demonsbane may be nice for not taking press turns on miss, but also will always take a full press turn as the phys is a chain effect, meaning you need to arrange turn order so he attacks on a half press turn.

With Panel 2 unlocked, Flauros absolutely wrecks Phys Democalypse Preliminary Phase, farming an absurd amount of multiplier due to the way his skills are coded (see Notes for more details).
Comboes well with Marici, as Iron Fist and Hell Leopard are considered different skills and will hence trigger Shimmer Arrow twice.
Can also be used in the Democalypse Boss Phase, as Hell Leopard will confer Tarukaja and Sukukaja to the team, allowing your other teammates to hit harder.","
Weak to Ice.
Does not gain true Phys Pierce unless fully panelled. This can cause issues with his innate Death Counter and/or when he runs out of MP. It also makes his Red Archetype less appealing as a result.
Low Base power on his skills means he will struggle to do damage.
P2 will consume the Rebellion buff granted by Hell Leopard. This ends up decreasing his damage, as the Rebellion buff is wasted on the 75BP chain instead of his 130BP (more if levelled) Iron Fist.","
In Democalypse Preliminary Phase, you can only gain the +0.1 weakness hit multiplier once per skill, no matter how many times the skill hits. This is why you cannot gain more than +0.4 multiplier from skills like Ashura, Dragon Blade and MahaLantine. However, Flauros can repeatedly gain weakness hit multiplier, as Hell Leopard, Iron Fist and his Panel 2 chain effect are coded as different skills, bypassing the 'only once per skill' limitation."

Demons die when they are killed by Baptisma, unable to be revived. This lets him counter Nebiros, Xi Wangmu and Clotho revive strats, making him an exceptional Anti-Meta unit.
Unlike Skull Knight's Sword of Actuation and Lilith A's Temptation, Baptisma is a Spell instead of an Elemental Physical Skill. While it cannot crit as a result, it also cannot miss, giving Flauros Hallel the edge against evasive units.
Halo of Hallel gains boost levels as the fight drags on. At max level, it confers team-wide Lydia and Luster Candy, providing your team an incredible amount of sustain.
Teal provides Repel Elec. When paired with Repel Pierce units such as Atavaka or Alilat he can soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.","
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Requires a good team built around him to really shine.","

Sword Deity's Might provides team-wide Rebellion every turn, massively increasing your team's physical damage. This is exceptionally powerful in Phys Democalypse, as scores there widely fluctuate depending on crits. It also increases the damage of all allies in a state of Rebellion.
Ryujin Reflection procs an AOE counter whenever your allies receive Physical damage, similar to how Asura shield functions in Battle Tower. It also casts Tarunda and Rakunda when it procs. This makes him a good check against faster, Physical-based teams like Koga Saburo and/or Sraosha.
Yellow provides him Iai Isshin, a Physical AOE that puts him in a state of Charge if the attack is successful. This is very devastating for Phys Democalypse Prelim, similar to how Neroâ˜† racks up insane numbers in Elec Democalypse Prelim.
Red gives him access to Tempest Slash +, a souped up version of Tempest Slash that hits harder and ignores Endures.","

"Gabriel","PR","P","4","3","3","5","5","
One of the core demons in the Archangels archetype. When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Word dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins. Since it is a Chain effect, it does not consume Press Turns even when hitting NDR.
Innate Thunder Reign and Elec Enhancement in Purple means she can function well as an Elec Mage too, particularly for Democalypse.","
Needs a specific team built fully around her.
Chain effects kills demons before they have a chance to talk, making her less useful for Aura Gate.
Weak to Dark.","
The 10% weakness damage bonus from Elec Enhancement also applies to non-Elec skills like God's Word. This allows her to further punish any Hecate, Nebiros and/or Alice A who leaves Light Weakness open.
Requires additional MP Support when going against Alice A teams.
Reflected God's Word will damage her because of innate Pierce. Beware of Repel Pierce units like Atavaka."
"Garuda","PYR","PR","4","4","3","3","1","
One of the fastest and most flexible demons in the game. With Speedster transferred, he can help your team hit various PvE battle speed requirements, while fulfilling either a support or additional DPS role depending on his build.
Vahana, p3, and p4 provide additional Evasion, and can stack with other evasion passives like Evade to make him a dodge tank.
Auto-Rakunda increases your team's damage output and synergizes well with his Turn 1 focus.","
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
Very low bulk.
Weak to Ice.","
More or less outclassed by Hresvelgr in PvP nowadays.
Red gives him access to discounted Maragidyne, giving him a cheap T1 nuke. Yellow makes him more support-oriented with Fog Breath."
"Garuda A","PY","PR","3","2","2","3","5","
Brilliant Wings fires a Piercing AOE Force attack every time any of your demons successfully dodges an attack. This makes him a powerful pick versus pure physical demons like Masakado and Guan Yu.
Brilliant Wings fits well with evasive demons such as Nekomata A.
Gale Talon is very damaging against lone targets like Bosses, making him very potent for Democalypse. It can also be used for PvP cleanup and/or Endure breaking.","
Weak to Ice.
Evasion is useless against Magic teams.
Gale Talon takes time to reach full potential, reducing his T1 effectiveness.
Needs a team built around him to be really effective.","
Brilliant Wings will trigger off chain attacks such as Susano-o A's Heavenly Valor. You can use this to your advantage by repeatedly passing against him for free chip damage."
"Gemori","T","PT","3","3","2","1","1","
Omniscient Guidance instantly increases the Boost Level of all your demons by 1 at the start of turn. This allows demons like Guts, Quetzalcoatl A and Beelzebubâ˜† to ramp faster, giving Guts access to Endure Break even on his first Dragon Slayer, and Beelzebubâ˜† AOE Mortal on his second turn.
Noblewoman Aid is a full defensive buff swing akin to a reverse Kuyo Flash, and at max Boost Level will last for 3 whole turns, allowing her to use other support skills in the meantime.
Purple gives her Epitome of Illusion, which goes well with the increased ailment resistance from Panel 1. With a Prayer (and optimally Infernal Mask) transfer she can fill a pseudo-cleric role much like Angra Mainyu.","
Weak to Ice unless Teal. This is particularly annoying against fast teams which typically run Hresvelgr.
Mediarama is a rather bad healing spell.","-"
"Gogmagog","T","T","4","2","2","4","3","
Very high bulk, which he can capitalize on thanks to innate Earthquake.
Three weaknesses makes him a good partner for Orcus.
Less competition for Brands compared to your other demons, as he relies on PDEF for damage.
Panels let him play a more support-oriented role, providing team-wide bonuses as long as he is alive.
Repel Phys in Teal pairs well with Repel Pierce units such as Atavaka for Phys Anti-Pierce.","
Abysmal AGI means he misses. A lot.
No innate Pierce.","
Single target nukes will still hurt him a lot, especially with bonus damage from exploiting his multiple weaknesses."
"Griffith","TR","PT","3","3","3","1","1","
Blade of the Absolute is an Almighty Physical attack with increased innate accuracy (1.5x), high crit rate and hits the same target multiple times, shredding Endures.
Hawk of Light refunds 3 MP and sets up Almighty Tetrakarn on kill, letting him spam Blade of the Absolute repeatedly while completely walling off demons like Shiva A.
Has evasion thanks to innate Evade and Hawk of Light providing an Evasion bonus.
Panel 2 provides him Null Charm and Null Bind. Paired with Null Mute and a Cleanse transfer (such as Prayer), he can function as an evasive cleric that can also help with DPS if a cleanser is not required.","
As he does not have any damage booster in his kit (outside of P3), damage transfers are mandatory if building him as an assassin.
Difficult to build as he requires too many stats to function, forcing you to choose which parts of his kit to specialize in.
Requires a good team built around him to really shine.
Outclassed by Beelzebub (Human) as an Almighty (Physical) Repeller.","
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun.
Red gives him access to discounted Vorpal Blade, which can be useful if you want a piercing AOE for PvE, especially since ANY kill will trigger Hawk of Light."
"Guan Yu","TR","PT","4","2","2","3","4","
No weaknesses and high VIT stats make him very tanky, especially with Life Brands.
High STR and native Phys Pierce make him a physical powerhouse.
Loyal God of War refunds MP and heals him on a kill, giving him insane amounts of self-sustain.
Innate Savage Glee lets him Crit and generate Press Turns effectively, especially if given Epitome of Carnage or paired with Crit boosters like Asura Lord or Kartikeya.
Purple gives him access to Null Mortal, making him even harder to kill.","
Low AGI stat means he will have accuracy issues. Dragon Blade's chain effect will not activate if it misses on the first target.
Only has ST skills unless in Red, which reduces his overall PvP usefulness.
Highly dependent on the first kill for tempo. Failing to secure the first kill will result in him not having enough MP for the next turn.","
A Null Curse transfer makes him unkillable by Alice A, and also stops Curse from interfering with Loyal God of War healing."
"Guts","P","P","4","3","3","5","2","
Extremely high Crit rate thanks to innate Savage Glee and The Struggler. Butcher in Purple further augments his damage.
Dragon Slayer does insane AOE Piercing Physical damage and bypasses Endure-type skills. It can also be cast Turn 1 due to its low MP cost.
Is decently tanky thanks to good bulk and The Struggler providing him a better Enduring Soul.
Panel 1 gives him access to a Piercing Fire Physical AOE that does not cost MP, very useful against MP denial teams.","
Having no innate ST skills means he will be walled by Phys Anti-Pierce. It is recommended to pair him with demons like Alice to eliminate Phys Anti-Pierce demons that prevent him from sweeping.
No natural Pierce outside Panel 2 might cause issues when out of MP.","
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Hecate","P","P","4","2","2","2","5","
Hell's Trivia is a cheap, hard-hitting spell that also functions as an Endure breaker. Coupled with her respectable MAG stat and Dark Enhancement in Purple, she can be built as a powerful dark mage.
Virtually immune to ailments thanks to Null Bind and Lunar Awakening. Transferring a cleanse skill like Prayer or Silent Prayer will allow her to function as a cleric, while still maintaining her offensive presence.
Panel 2 lets her run Life or Spell brands without worrying about MP.","
Not very bulky due to middling VIT and HP stats.
Weak to Light and by extension the Archangels matchups.
As Lunar Awakening only cleanses at the end of the enemy's turn, she can still be killed by Alice A if she is cursed in the same turn (such as through Mahaju).","
Innate Repel Dark means she can't be sniped by Alice if paired with Alilat or Atavaka. This is very significant as most dedicated ailment teams run Alice to remove the cleric.
Lunar Awakening only triggers at the end of the enemy's turn. This makes her useless for Brands of Sin Sloth 11, as the ailments trigger at the beginning of the turn."
"Heimdall","Y","PY","3","4","4","2","2","
Bifrost Keeper boost his bulk up to 50% hp, and at the start of the first two enemy turns, gives him a 2500 hp Bulwark, and increases his teams defense, making him and his entire team harder to kill. Additionally, on the start of his own turn, he raises the attack of his team, helping his team counter sweep.
Stout Horn is a versatile attack, doing a high amount of ST almighty damage, and adding a bulwark to his whole team when his hp is above 80%, or doing fractional damage based on max hp to the whole enemy team when his hp is below 80%.
Intimidating Stance in purple works well with his low agi of 102, and Lunar Downfall works as well if both stances are covered, say by a demon like Cthulhu
Panels include Null Bind to help him do his chain effects, an almighty damage boost, and a large amount of additional HP.","
No Null Mortal leaving him vulnerable to demons that have mortal attacks.
Focuses mostly on tankiness for himself, meaning his team might be vulnerable to being swept. Additionally, even if he is the sole survivor against a fast sweeping team, it's unlikely he can counter sweep with his skill set.
With no ability to hit weakness or crit, his almighty skills are liable to use a full press turn, hurting your press turn economy.","-"
"Hresvelgr","PR","PY","4","4","4","5","3","
Highest base AGI in the game, making him invaluable for fast teams.
His unique North Wind deals AOE Ice damage whenever an opposing demon dies. This adds to the damage of fast Turn 1 teams and allows him to clear Endures.
Auto-Rakunda in Purple further increases Turn 1 kill potential.
Decent MAG with innate Ice Boost lets him fire off strong Bufudynes.","
No Ice Pierce.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
Weak to Phys and Fire, both very bad ones in the current meta. Phys Weakness is particularly terrible unless paired with Orcus for Press Turn denial.","-"
"Huang Di","R","PR","3","1","1","5","3","
Superior Power gives him Phys Pierce and an accuracy boost.
Yinglong Killer hits incredibly hard and has a high crit rate, demolishing teams without anti-Pierce.","
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Yinglong Killer has a very high MP cost and cannot be fired off Turn 1.
Below average HP and VIT stats.","
More or less outclassed by Guts. Oh how the mighty have fallen!
AI is very unreliable for PvP Defense; he will occasionally Yinglong Killer into Anti-Pierce and lose Press Turns.
Panel 3 healing has some fun applications together with Lakshmi A, allowing him to restore both HP and MP to the whole party upon a crit."
"Huang Long","PY","PY","4","2","2","1","1","
High AGI, incredible resistances and decent bulk make him a coveted PvE support demon.
Five Elements walls every magical demon without Pierce, including Almighty mages such as Mother Harlot and Trumpeter.
Luster Candy in Yellow gives him even more support utility in buff control. Purple provides him Speedster, giving him full flexibility over which skills to transfer.
Trivializes Brands of Sin Stages 10, opening up brand farming on Auto.
Reduces all magic damage by 35% when in a state of magic repel while increasing damage 20% for all allies, making him a magic version of Human Beelzebub.","
Pierce bypasses Five Elements.
Five Elements can be removed through Makara Break, most notably by P3 Samael.
When Five Elements blocks an attack, it's broken, meaning, only the first attack is blocked, so, if the enemy has a chance to attack again in the same turn, that attack will pass.
Very MP hungry, needs Divine Brands or Mana Aid to function well.","
Yellow AI has issues on auto as it will sometimes cast Luster Candy when you want to be spamming Five Elements instead. Due to this, Yellow is mostly recommended for Manual Play, and Purple for Auto-ing.
Skills like makara shift should work with his panel 3, giving the same effect as caveman"
"Indrajit","P","P","3","2","2","3","5","
Lightning Shower provides incredible burst damage due to its high Base Power combined with Indrajit's high base MAG and innate Master Assassin. It can also be looped indefinitely thanks to its low MP cost and Lord of Clouds refunding 3 MP on kill.
Lord of Clouds provides Elec Pierce and autocasts Five Elements on kill, which completely walls off Almighty mages like Mother Harlot.
Innate Merciless Blow combined with high damage output makes him very valuable for Democalypse.","
Weak to Ice.
Low bulk means he will get killed easily if outsped.","
Highly dependant on the first kill for tempo. Failing to kill will result in MP Problems.
Has AI issues when used on defense - AI will occasionally target demons with high HP instead of trying to finish off demons to secure Lord of Clouds activation."
"Ishtar","Y","TY","2","2","2","4","3","
Extremely high MAG stat. Panel 1 further increases her AOE damage.
Her unique spell Mesopotamian Star deals Almighty damage while auto-casting Tarukaja and Tarunda. At Panel 3, this further applies Rakukaja and Sukukaja, allowing her to deal damage while simultaneously buffing and debuffing.
Gains Concentrate in Yellow, letting her nuke even harder.","
Very high MP costs.
Mesopotamian Star has low base power.
Weak to Force and Dark.
Low AGI stat and bad bulk.","
Due to her high MAG and Panel 1 bonus, she works very well as an elemental caster for Democalypse if you can transfer the appropriate elemental spell."

Upon death, Yaxche autocasts an almighty Mortal spell that will instakill the enemy that killed her, bypassing Endures.
Yellow gives her access to discounted Mahashibabooon, letting her also function as an Ailment inflictor.","
Five Elements and Null Mortal blocks Yaxche, shutting her down.
Most important targets in PvE are immune to Mortal (Bosses, Kiwami Adds, etc.).","
There is no way to reset her level once you have leveled her up.
You can leave her at Lv 1 to bait the AI into killing her and triggering Yaxche. Pair her with teammates that carry resurrection spells to repeat this cycle like Nebiros and Xi Wangmu.
Leaving her at Lv 1 also sharply drops your battle speed, perfect for slow teams."
"Izanami","PR","P","3","1","1","5","4","
Very high Magic stat. Combined with innate Merciless Blow, her unique Yomotsu Okami and Elec Amp in Purple, she will decimate anything weak to Elec or Dark.
Yomotsu Okami provides a teamwide increase to Dark and Elec damage, perfect for Democalypse.
Great set of panels that provide her MP reduction, Elec Pierce and increased damage.","
Weak to Fire.
Very expensive to fuse.
No innate AOE spells.
Very RNG reliant in Democalypse as you cannot rely on Eileen to weather out bad Bolt Storm rolls.","
Panel 2 for Elec Pierce is mandatory for PvP.
Red gives her Hell Gaze, while Purple provides Elec Amp. As both are very useful for their respective elemental Democalypse, consider building two of them if your Faction does these elements."

Gomorrah (J) has high base damage and crit chance, with a high chance to Bind all enemies.
Pairs well with Bayonettaâ˜† or any other sources of charm like Lakshmi.","
Gomorrah (J) takes two turns to charge, and is difficult to build due to it scaling off both PATK and MATK.
Awkward combination of balanced stats and having both Physical and Magic skills make her pretty mediocre at everything.

Mortal Jihad plus Great Aim means he will rarely miss, while having a good crit rate to generate Press Turns for your team.
No weaknesses and innate Speedster gives him great flexibility over transfer slots and lets him fulfill a variety of roles.","
No innate Pierce means he will have trouble with Repel Physical effects (notably Tetraka Shift), unless you inherit Phys Pierce (weak).
Very expensive to Fuse.","
Difficult to Panel due to Clear demons only giving 60 spirits.
Works very well in Turn 1 teams like Hero Masakado T1."
"Koga Saburo","P","P","4","4","4","5","3","
Dragon of Defense passively increases his accuracy and provides a full Agile Cry buff swing, which greatly helps him (and his allies) land hits.
Soaring Blades is a multi-hitting Force (Physical) ST nuke that chains into another multi-hit Force AOE. Not only does it hit incredibly hard thanks to high base crit rate (50%) and innate Force Amp in Purple, it's also very spammable thanks to a low MP cost of 5.
High base AGI and increased Battle Speed from Panel 2 make him invaluable for fast teams. Transfer Speedster if you need even more zoom!
Force Anti-Pierce is very rare in the current meta, allowing him to sweep with impunity. Even on the rare occasion you do encounter Force Anti-Pierce, you can simply cast Soaring Blades on another demon that does not Drain/Repel it - even if the chain AOE is Anti-Pierced, it won't consume Press Turns due to it being a chain effect.
Has pretty much the perfect stats for a glass cannon T1 sweeper - top tier AGI, STR and high LUK.","
Weak to Ice, though admittedly this is less of a concern for T1 teams.
Loses turns if he misses even 1 of 4 ST Soaring Blades strikes. Missing on the AOE is fine though, as missed chain effects won't consume Press Turns.
Very frail, needs an Endure-type transfer (preferably Force Survivor) to reliably survive Moirai sister comps.","
He is nigh unusable without Panel 2 in Democalypse, as Soaring Blades only has 3 charges by default. Unlocking Panel 2 increases this to 6, which is just enough for a Prelim team, or a non-Mot team for Boss.
Has AI issues when used on defense - AI will usually target demons with high HP instead of trying to kill off frail demons. This can be very devastating if he decides to go for evasive demons like Angra Mainyu.
While Soaring Blades has a high crit rate, it is not unfailable especially against targets running Epitome of Fortitude. Crit-boosting transfers like Epitome of Finesse, Savage Glee and Auto-Rebellion go a long way in improving his consistency."
"Lachesis","P","P","2","3","3","1","1","
One of the core demons in the Moirai Sisters archetype. When combined with two other Lady or Femme demons (preferably her two other sisters), Passionate Embrace debuffs enemies' attack and defense while buffing yours. Not only does this make Atropos' Passionate Rage stronger, it also makes it harder for the opponents to fight back as they will have to deal with a massive reduction in damage.
Measured Fate removes all debuffs from your team and buffs from the enemy team. This ensures the following Passionate Embrace will fully swing buffs in your favor.
Intimidating Stance in Purple synergizes well with the rest of the Moirai Sisters who have very low AGI.
Her Panels provide valuable ailment immunity, making it harder for Ailment Teams to sweep her on revenge.","
Requires a good team built around her to work.
Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.","
The AI will not cast Measured Fate if there are no buffs on your opponent and/or debuffs on you. As she does not have any other actives, this causes her to auto-attack most of the time, which can be a problem facing NDR Phys or evasive targets."
"Ladon","T","PT","2","4","4","1","1","
Dragon of Hesperia deals 30% of current HP as Fractional damage whenever an enemy heals. This is very effective against demons like Beelzebubâ˜† and Erlkonig, who have passives that restore HP. It will also remove Lydia and cast a 2-turn Tarunda and Rakunda, further fueling the Erlkonig hate.
Dragon of Hesperia also provides him Null Mortal, and innate Null Bind means his passives cannot easily be stopped.
Fury Raid casts Rakunda and Sukunda before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if it misses and/or hits into Phys NDR+Anti-Pierce, allowing him to spam it without concern.
Purple gains Intimidating Stance, whereas Teal gains Drain Phys for pairing with Demiurge.","
Weak to Ice.
Doesn't do much damage due to lack of damage boosters in his kit.","
Part of the Vile Team, together with Pales, Demiurge and Ladon. This combination has Anti-Pierce coverage for every element sans Force, has access to double Intimidating Stance thanks to Pales and is generally very bulky."

Extremely high Magic and Luck stats allow her to be built as either a Sweeper or an Ailment inflictor.

"Lanling Wang","","PY","4","4","4","3","5","
Is the first demon to come with a counter to Gloom, called Zenith, granting his team accuracy, evasion, crit rate, ailment infliction, crit resist, and ailment resist through the status. Additionally, when your team is in a state of Zenith, he gives the entire party Phys Amp and 30% crit rate, making him exceptional for fast physical teams
Flying High hits like a truck, doing 200 bp with 50% crit rate for 5mp, or 4mp with p2, while ignoring endures, and when he hits, sends his team into Zenith. It hits so hard, especially charged in Zenith, that even with brands that make you choose between accuracy and damage, you can get some extra accuracy and still do tons of damage.
Once per turn, Mask of Veiled Beauty will give him charge when an opponent is downed. If he's in charge from a previous turn, he can kill something with a charged Flying High and still go into charge, enabling massive damage over multiple turns.
Is fast with 232 agi, along with 20% innate battle speed, 20% more from panels, and 20% more from Phys Accele in purple.
Good panels in general, providing innate mp reduction to Flying High, innate Phys Prana, and battle speed and damage.","
His AI is garbage and will not Flying High three times in a row, regardless of MP. This means if he could get 3 in a turn due to press turn generation, he still won't use it, even though the third would be under a state of Zenith against Gloom.
Turn order is complicated because you want him to go after units like Astaroth and Hero Masakado, who can end up killing units and using skills to swing buffs, also leading to him getting charge, but on the other hand, you want Lanling early in turn order to provide Zenith to the rest of your team.
Doesn't actually put your team into Zenith until after his second Flying High versus Gloom.
Is essentially exclusively single target, because if you aren't using Flying High, you miss his gimmick of Zenith, and the massive buffs he provides, making him less useful.
If you miss on a fast phys team, you're as good as done, and his early actions in a turn could still potentially be under Gloom, making missing a real potential.","-"

Demons die when they are killed by Temptation, unable to be revived. This lets her counter Nebiros, Xi Wangmu and Clotho revive strats, making her an exceptional Anti-Meta unit.
Temptation can be fired off Turn 1 due to its low MP cost (5 MP), even against Alice A by using Divine Brands. It will also apply an AOE Charm if the attack is successful, which synergizes well with her passive.
In addition to granting her Dark Pierce, Forbidden Fruit fires off another Temptation at the end of the turn if anyone is charmed. This lets her break Endures and/or clean up any remaining units.
Panel 2 grants her a whopping +50% Crit Chance, which helps to boost her damage.
She can be paired with Rama as a soft-counter to Atropos as she has innate Drain Elec. This also somewhat offsets her fraility, one of her main cons.","
Weak to Light.
Requires a good team setup around her to truly shine, as Temptation has relatively low BP and no increased crit rate. Even with Dark Amp in Purple, she will have damage issues unless you grant her Auto-Rebellion and ensure buffs are in her favor (for example via Kuyo Flash).
Damage is lackluster in Dark Democalypse Boss Phase, as the Boss has +100% Crit Resist.
Relatively frail, requires Panels and/or Life Brands to survive in PvP, Passionate Rage in particular.","
Red gives her access to discounted Mamudodyne, useful if you want a piercing AOE. She can run it relatively well due to Temptation also scaling off MATK."
"Lucifer","P","P","3","4","4","5","5","
Morning Star is the most powerful Almighty AOE spell in the game. Combined with Butcher in Purple, this allows him to deal massive amounts of damage.
Panel 4 casts a 1 turn Debilitate at the start of each turn. Not only does it augment your team's damage, it also procs AFTER enemy auto skills, making it very useful to reapply debuffs or cancel out their auto-buffs.
Good bulk especially with Panel 2 unlocked. This helps him live long enough to build up the MP necessary for Morning Star.
Fast-Debilitate from Panel 4 is incredibly useful in both phases of Democalypse.","

Hell's Ministry reduces Almighty cost for all Tyrant-race demons and improves their bulk. Paired with his Panel 1 Bonus, this will give a whopping 2MP discount and enable powerful Turn 1 combos such as Lucifer's Morning Star.
Light Devourer is a hard-hitting single target Dark spell, further amplified by innate Dark Amp.

Drunken Giant reduces fire and phys damage taken, adds fire pierce, and gives his team a bulwark when his team goes second, or any time an enemy is charmed. Additionally it offers 20% max hp when leveled.
Scarlet Inferno does potentially 310 fire damage to a single target, and also charms on the eight random hits, enabling more bulwarks.
A solid set of panels that give him more hp, damage reduction, fire damage, and gives him Dionysus's passive, with a 50% chance to charm anybody who strikes him with a physical attack.
Intimidating Stance in purple synergizes great with his skill set and his low agi.
A kit hand crafted to disable fast turn 1 physical attacker teams.
A solid stat spread with high luck, vit, and mag, while also having only 93 agi.","
What is arguably his signature trait in charming attackers is locked behind Panel 2.
His strengths are pretty one sided. While he is exceptional against fast teams, he struggles against slower teams and doesn't provide much value.
While devastating against a single opponent, besides the first hit, the secondary hits of Scarlet Inferno will only tickle, especially against a bulky set of opponents.
Has no way to remove barriers, and also is vulnerable to mortal.
Vulnerable to fire anti-pierce because you can't control the secondary hits of Scarlet Inferno","
He only reduces Fire and Phys damage, so it's important to keep that in mind when you're facing other damage sources."

High Magic stats and innate Concentrate + Pierce from The Great Darkness make him a very powerful ST Nuker.
Wrathful Flame reduces defense, allowing your teammates to hit harder. When maxed it can also be cast Turn 1 in PvP without the need of divine brands.
Very effective in Democalypse boss rounds as buffs/debuffs are difficult to come by.
Goes through Endure as Wrathful Flame is three separate hits.","
Combination of ST and AOE in his kit makes it difficult to further boost his damage.","
Unlike Indrajit, lack of MP recovery means he cannot spam Wrathful Flame as easily in PvP.

"Mahamayuri","PT","PT","4","4","4","2","5","
Kujaku Myo-o makes him immune to Ailments and Auto-cleanses your entire party at the start of turn. This is incredibly powerful for Battle Tower - as the MC is forced to move first, other Clerics cannot prevent him from wasting a Press Turn.
Hits fairly hard due to innate Force Amp, high BP on Blossoming Cyclone and a good MAG stat. As a bonus, it also heals your whole party, allowing him to provide sustain the same way Ardha does.
Possesses the extremely coveted Repel Force, which makes him a great pair for Repel Pierce units such as Demiurge (for comparison, the only other 'generalist' Repel Force demons are Mot and Mastema, as Raphael and Pale Rider only work in specific compositions).
Teal can be used to patch up his Elec Weakness, while Master Assassin in Purple lets him hit harder.","
Weak to Elec. This is especially bad against Atropos.
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk/evasion; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.","
Comparatively, Daisoujou is better as a pure support demon (no weaknesses, provides buff control, can focus purely on survivability/evasion, more flexible on transfers), while Mahamayuri offers more offensive pressure and better Press Turn economy. Pick whichever your team needs more.
The AOE version of Mayuri. Tutturu~"
"Mara","P","P","3","2","1","3","5","
Only fusible source of Phys Pierce in Purple (aside from Fafnir, who will be impotent in most situations).
High STR and LUK means he will hit hard and crit often.
Hell Thrust is very strong against bosses and in Democalypse, especially if he is Panel 3.
Meme","
Ice Weakness and non-existent bulk makes him go limp at the sight of Ice skills.
High MP costs give Mara a big refractory period.
Expensive to fuse, will quickly blow through your Magnetite reserves.
Requires damage boost transfers to supplement his damage.
Middling AGI means he will have accuracy issues and occasionally miss the hole. Also doesn't slot into Intimidating Stance teams well as a result.
Due to Mara having no single target besides his regular thrust, Anti-Pierce units like Rama, Alilat and Atavaka are a turn off.","
A requirement in Phys PvE teams with Zaou-Gongen to pound through waves and bosses (such as in AG2 Boss Rush and Hells Park 91-99), as Auto-Charge is an incredibly powerful effect."
"Maria","PY","PY","4","5","5","1","1","
Demons no longer die when they are killed by revive sealing skills, because Maria cleanses revive seal on ally death, including on herself.
In addition to removing revive seal, she also casts a one turn Luster Candy on her team and heals.
Is ridiculously tanky, with 70% hp boost built into her kit, and more bulk in panels. This innate bulk allows her to still have high hp totals even when built for evasion.
Is immune to ailments and has Salvation built into her kit to cleanse for her party, with a large mp reduction and charge increase in p1
Swings defensive buffs in her teams favor every turn with p2.
In addition to making her team near impossible to kill, she also gives her entire team Infinite Chakra, allowing them to use their skills much more freely.
If you do manage to kill anybody on her team, at the end of her turn, she will revive her entire team once per game. She additionally has more revives through a skill in yellow.
Is so absurdly powerful that she can fit in any team from slow teams to a mana battery in fast teams, and anything in between.
Completely redefined the pvp meta. If you don't have a way to deal with her bulk and revive, you're going to struggle to climb","
While still amazing without them, her power really spikes with p1 and p2
If she is revive sealed, Xi Wangmu will not revive her even though she removes the revive seal due to how the game is coded, with on self death triggers activating after ally death triggers
Has no innate evasion so you really need cracked brands to get her evasion high.
Her agi is middling, making her a bit tricky to fit into slow and fast teams.","-"
"Marici","P","P","2","3","4","1","1","
Shimmer Arrow lets her follow up ANY physical skill with a piercing Light ST nuke. This is great for cleaning up Endures and spreading out chip damage.
Daylight Blade deals Piercing Phys damage while putting her into a state of Concentrate, allowing her chained Shimmer Arrow to hit much harder. This effectively gives her a 300 Base Power ST nuke (360 if it crits!) that also ignores Endures.
Incredible synergy with Sraosha, as Shimmer Arrow will proc off his Soul Judgement chain, letting you snowball kills with multiple chain effects.
Works great in Brands of Sin Sloth 10-12 where a majority of the enemies are weak to light.","
Unimpressive STR stats, low base power on both her skills and no damage boosters in her kit severely hurt her damage output.
Difficult to boost her damage due to her being a dual Physical and Light Hybrid attacker.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","
For manual play, Shimmer Arrow will hit whoever your cursor is on. On Auto and/or Defense however, you are at the mercy of the AI for who she snipes."
"Masakado","P","PT","5","4","4","5","3","
Innate Phys Amp in Purple combined with a MASSIVE STR stat allows him to dish out ridiculous amounts of Physical damage.
Warlord's Wrath is a loaded passive that combines Intimidating Stance, Faithful Counter and Phys Pierce.
Occult Flash is a high damage, high crit-rate single target skill that will inflict Mortal with 100% chance.
Has no weakness and a perfect base kit, allowing you to tailor his remaining transfer slots however you like.
Gains Drain Phys in Teal which synergizes well with his innate Drain Dark, allowing him to act as Anti-Pierce for both Phys and Dark when paired with Drain Pierce units such as Rama or Demiurge.","
Low Agility leads to accuracy issues, especially against evasive targets.
Is very frail thanks to a low VIT and HP stat.","-"
"Masakado A","","P","5","5","5","5","3","
Guardian of the East provides 1 extra Press Turn when going first, enabling devastating Turn 1 Kill strategies like Hero Masakado T1.
Kuyo Flash can be cast 1st turn and swings offensive buffs entirely in your favor by autocasting Tarukaja, Rakunda, Sukukaja and Sukunda.
Panel 2 provides team wide Null Mortal for one turn. This is useful for sweeping Ixtab defenses, or protecting your allies from being counterswept by Alice A if you fail to kill them Turn 1.
Incredible set of resistances with 3 Nulls (Phys, Dark, Light) and no weakness allows you to tailor his transfer slots however you please.","
No good physical attacks to exploit his innate Phys Pierce. Only Phys attack available to him is Myriad Arrows in Red, which has random targeting and is thus not very reliable.
Easily countered by outspeeding. This is a problem for last hour PvP, as Masakado A defenses will get relentlessly targetted by players looking to climb last minute.","
Unable to be paired with Masakado.
None of his Awaken skills are particularly useful for him. Enduring Soul is his 'best' one but it won't be that useful considering that he's built for a fast team where the only thing that matters is high offensive power and high accuracy for Phys attackers. Myriad Arrows could be useful to take advantage of his innate Pierce, but as just said it isn't a good Phys spell."
"Mastema","P","P","3","1","1","5","3","
Good Magic coupled with Trial of Hate's high base power makes him an incredible Light sweeper. The debuff is icing on the cake.
Good set of resistances with 1 Null and 2 Reflects.
Works well in Archangel Teams to provide more sweeping power.
Laughs at his enemies occasionally.","
No innate Pierce, requires Light Pierce (weak) to really shine.
Weak to Fire. This is especially problematic in Brands of Sin Sloth 11 and above, as the boss has innate Trisagion.
Binding Cry while a flavorful skill is unfortunately wasted on Mastema.","
Easy 4x4 fusion paths and good panels make him a decent Panel 3 goal to strive toward."
"Master Therion","","P","2","2","2","1","1","
Blasphemy is a piercing Ice/Fire nuke that also Charms and Poisons their whole party. With innate Null Mute, he does not need to worry about Preach from opposing Daisoujou, though make sure not to get your other allies muted!
Mark of the Beast deals fixed damage and mutes all enemies at the end of his turn. Fixed damage goes through the Main Character's shield in Battle Tower, allowing you to deal full damage even if his allies are still alive.
P2 gives him Auto-Barrier Break if going first, turning him into a standalone ailment package similar to Motoko Kusanagi (except less visually appealing).","
Panel 2 is mandatory for the Auto-Barrier Break. He is just another mediocre ailment demon otherwise.
No longer has a suggestive silhoutte.
Weak to Light.","
Great synergy with Angra Mainyu - Master Therion breaks barriers for him, allowing Angra Mainyu to cripple their whole team with 16 Scourges while triggering Mark of the Beast for cleanup at the end of turn. They are also both decently fast and fit naturally in speed teams."
"Maya","PY","P","3","2","2","1","1","
Will virtually never have MP issues thanks to Glamorous Allure giving her a free Almighty AOE attack that has a chance of charm.
Upon any allies being Muted, she will counter with Illusionary World, cleansing the Mute and retaliating with an Almighty AOE Sweep. This makes her ideal for punishing Daisoujou, whose team will take chip damage from Illusionary World every time his Preach is triggered.
Innate Null Charm, Null Bind in Purple and Illusionary World makes her virtually immune to skill-restricting ailments. Transferring a cleanse skill like Prayer will allow her to serve as the team's Cleric, while still being able to deal chip damage thanks to Glamorous Allure.
High Luck and huge amount of built-in Ailment Infliction help her land Charm from Glamorous Allure reliably.","
Fairly mediocre MAG and unimpressive Base Power on both skills hurt her damage potential.
Very harshly countered by Five Elements on Defense, as the AI does not know how to pass and will lose Press Turns attacking into it.","
She has a powerful niche during certain Tower seasons that guarantee Ailments, as she will never run out of MP for charming."
"Meliodas","","","4","4","4","5","5","
High base str, agi, and decent luck make him a good candidate for fast sweeping teams.
Innate crit rate and hit rate from The Ten Commandments help him pass turns and land his hits even against the most evasive enemies.
His 2mp physical discount allows him to fire off cheap Megaton Raids and Gigantomachias freely, giving him flexibility in targeting as well.
Trillion Dark's chain effect adds even more damage to his hard hitting attacks and also can be used to help chip down evasive targets safely, without risking press turns.
Every color has a niche, allowing flexibility in team building.","
No innate buff control other than Auto-Taruka in yellow and Rakunda in p2 means he needs either transfers or his team to cover buff control, and transfer slots are highly contested in fast teams
No innate speed boosters without panels, along with his agi not being THAT high means he slows your team down.
Is outclassed at his role by other stronger sweepers like Astaroth and Koga Saburo
His chain being dark can be a liability and lead to him killing himself against anti-pierce","-"
"Metatron","R","YC","3","2","2","4","4","
Good HP and VIT stats paired with great resistances gives him decent bulk, especially with innate Enduring Soul in Clear. This is further improved by Panel 2 providing Magic Resistance and Panel 4 reducing all forms of damage he takes by 20%.
High Magic stat and Infinite Chakra lets him function well as a magic sweeper.
Works well in an Archangels Team, as Fire of Sinai is great for cleaning up and breaking Endures (especially with Panel 4) and can be cast T1 thanks to Infinite Chakra and Panel 1.
Gains discounted Mahamadyne in Red, which is great for Brands of Sin Sloth 10 and 11 farming.
Panel 3 amplifies all Magic damage.","
Very difficult to fuse, only 1 recipe available (Barong + Vishnu). This is particularly bad as he has four panels to work on instead of the regular three.
Only random target skills is a great disadvantage in PvP, meaning he can't do much outside being a cleaner for Archangels Teams. Mahamadyne in Red does not really resolve the problem.
Full Almighty / non-Piercing kit means he is shut down hard by Five Elements.
Low AGI stat penalizes him in Archangels teams.","
Still needs some kind of MP sustain (and possibly Panel 1) to cast Fire of Sinai T1 when facing Alice A.
The bonus hits provided by Panel 4 are coded as a different skill from Fire of Sinai and will not inherit effects such as Concentrate."
"Michael","TYR","TR","3","3","2","2","5","
Soul Judgement deals massive damage against single targets, ideal for Bosses and Democalypse.
While he has pretty mediocre MAG stats, Panels 1 and 3 help to offset this by providing him a whopping +40% to Light damage.
Panel 2 and 4 increase his Battle Speed, allowing him to act as the team's Speedster particularly for Archangels.
Panel 4 confers Light Pierce to all Herald and Divine demons in the party. This is very useful for Mastema who does not have Light Pierce in his kit.
Panel 4 also provides a 15% damage boost to all Herald and Divine demons in the party (himself included). This is very useful for Archangel teams in both PvP and Democalypse.
Yellow gives him access to discounted Mediarahan, allowing him to double as a healer in PvE.
Very good set of resistances, especially in Teal.","
Weak to Dark.
No Pierce until Panel 4 and overall mediocre stats.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
Soul Judgement being random target is ill-suited for PvP, especially considering Light is commonly covered by Anti-Pierce (for example Pales + Demiurge).
Red is not suited for Democalypse boss, since it may cause AI to use Thunderclap instead of Soul Judgement, resulting in less damage output.
Needs Panel 4 to be good in PvP, requiring a lot of investment.","-"
"Mot","","PYR","3","2","2","5","5","
His high bulk pairs well with Harmonious Death which is strong in extended fights.
Harmonious Death makes Mot a must-have in Democalypse Prelim teams. At Panel 3, he becomes perfect for Democalypse Boss teams.

Amazing set of panels that provide him MP reduction, Null Mortal and even more Press Turns.","
Weak to Elec.
High MP costs.","-"
"Motoko Kusanagi","P","TY","3","3","2","2","1","
She is essentially an entire Ailment Team neatly packaged into one demon. Not only does Ghost Hack remove Barriers, it also has a high chance of inflicting Bind and Mute, in addition to only costing 5 MP to cast. With Panel 2 unlocked, this further chains into a Tarukaja and Sukukaja buff.
At the end of her turn, Optical Camouflage hits every demon suffering an ailment with a Piercing Phys AOE. This damage can be further ramped up by the discounted Charge she gains in Yellow.
Due to how packed her kit is, she can easily be splashed into teams looking for some Ailment control, or in Defense teams to catch players randoming without sufficient Ailment protection.
Panel 3 gives her increased Battle Speed, allowing her to act as a pseudo-Speedster.","
Her damage is fairly underwhelming due to a low STR stat and lack of any damage boosters in her kit.
Hard-countered by Ailment immunity, most notably Daisoujou and Panelled Moirai Sisters like Atropos + Lachesis.","
Yellow discounts Charge to 5 MP. With Divine Brands, she can cast both Ghost Hack and Charge on the same turn going first. This is not possible against Alice A without some MP support though.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Mother Harlot","","T","2","4","4","1","1","
Babylon Goblet drains MP from all enemies while providing her MP sustain, allowing her to loop the same attack over and over even without Divine Brands. With Panel 2 unlocked, she will additionally spread charm all over the enemy's team.
Teal gives her Drain Phys, ideal for pairing with Rama. Notably, she is one of only two Drain Phys units that can function as a magic sweeper. Innate Drain Elec also helps to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.
Has access to discounted Debilitate in Yellow, letting her play a more support role if needed.
Works very well in a slow Ailment Team, or with Alice A in MP denial teams.
Incredible set of Panels. With Panel 3 unlocked, she can keep enemies permanently charmed by reapplying Charm each turn.","
Weak to Force.
Full Almighty kit means she is shut down hard by Five Elements.
Low AGI and high MP costs makes her unsuitable for fast teams.","
The MP drain aspect of Babylon Goblet is less useful for PvE, as the AI has infinite MP. It does allow you to replenish her MP indefinitely though."
"Mozgus","R","TY","2","1","1","2","2","
The only unit in the game that has a Critical Counter, God 1000 Fist Cannon will unleash a random barrage of piercing Phys attacks whenever the enemy scores a crit.
Extremely high bulk and damage reduction from Bloody Scripture make him a powerful tank. Building him as a tank also increases God 1000 Fist Cannon and Muscle Punch damage, as they both depend on Phys DEF for damage. Earthquake in Red furthers this synergy.
Yellow gives him access to discounted War Cry, letting him play a support role if required.","
God 1000 Fist Cannon has low base power.
Does not have Pierce outside of God 1000 Fist Cannon.

Weak to Fire.","
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Murmur","Y","PY","3","2","2","2","2","
Duke of Hell provides him damage and ST damage reduction for each open weakness on your party. This gives him a natural spot in Orcus comps, who typically run a large amount of open weaknesses.
Dynamic Evil Spear is a piercing Dark ST nuke with a high crit rate. If it lands, it will also ressurect ALL your allies at 30% HP, making it a pseudo-Recarmdra that can grant a half-turn if you crit. It also provides a 20% accuracy bonus if maxed, which pairs well with his innate Epitome of Aggression and Panel 1 both granting accuracy.
Purple gains access to Null Mortal, whereas Yellow grants him Auto-Sukunda for PVE.","
You still receive extra damage from open weaknesses. Fire weakness is particularly annoying against Surt A and Atropos.
No innate damage boosters means he is forced to rely on Duke of Hell for damage.
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.
Orcus comps are very vulnerable to Mortal, which is rampant in the current PvP Meta thanks to Beelzebubâ˜†.","
Dynamic Evil Spear only has 6 charges. Be very careful when using it, as you might end up running out of charges and be forced into a regular attack."
"Nebiros","PT","PT","4","3","2","1","1","
Call of the Dead is the only revive skill in the game without a usage limit. This enables infinite revives, especially if paired with healing supports like Nadja.
As Call of the Dead triggers at the end of the enemy turn, it lets you start yours with full Press Turns, and proc any start of turn chain effects like Archangels.
Hand of Glory provides AOE Curse + Luster Candy on ally death. The Curse is a great setup for Alice A (and his own passive), while the buffs increase your likelihood of surviving the turn.
Highest Luck in the game paired with innate Epitome of Madness makes him a great Dodge tank.
Panel 2 grants Null Mortal which makes him even harder to kill.","
Hard countered by Null Curse and revive sealing skills like Sword of Actuation. Panel 1 Clotho in particular is a very powerful counter, as she confers the whole team Null Curse.
Weak to light and by extension the Archangels matchup. Teal fixes this somewhat but you lose Null Bind in return.
Call of the Dead can be mitigated by a Cleric removing Curse before the end of the turn.","-"
"Nergal","PR","P","1","3","2","4","2","
Plague of Babylon removes Barriers and has a very high chance of landing Weak status, making him an incredible setup for Ailment Teams.
High STR, Auto-Tarukaja in Purple and increased Accuracy from Meslamtaea make him a decent Physical demon, especially when Paneled.
Auto-Rebellion on Poison boosts his damage and synergizes with Pale Rider.
Nergal is particularly strong against Cleric Angra Mainyu, as he can stack massive amounts of infliction to brute-force Weak through Angra's ailment resistance, which then lets you land your own Ailments to disable him from cleansing.","
Weak to Ice.
Ailments fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats.
Hard countered by Ailment Cleansers like Daisoujou or Mahamayuri in PvP.
No innate Pierce until Panel 3 is unlocked.","
P3 Samael offers similar barrier break without consuming a Press Turn. This is vital versus double Intimidating Stance Teams, as Nergal consuming a Press Turn means you are left with a single Press for casting a true ailment.
Compared to P3 Samael, Nergal gives your other demons more flexibility in choosing brands, as they can forego Ailment Infliction completely. Weigh the extra Press Turn versus stat flexibility carefully."
"Nero â˜†","","PR","3","2","2","5","3","
Overture deals Piercing damage while giving him free Concentrate, letting him sweep hard.
Voltage synergises perfectly with Overture and gives your party attack and accuracy/evasions buffs.
Very good for Democalypse where he does not have to worry about MP issues and can repeatedly spam Concentrated Overtures while on Spell Brands for insane damage.","
Hard countered by Anti-Pierce, as Overture will not autocast Concentrate (and by extension Voltage) if the attack hits into NDR.
Mediocre stats, relies on Concentrate from Overture to deal damage.
No ST skills if not in Red.

Moment of Fate procs Dekaja + Luster Candy on the boss wave. This is great for PvE content with Auto-Debilitate such as Brands of Sin Sloth 11 and 12 stages and certain Kiwamis.
High MAG stat plus innate Merciless Blow makes her a great demon for Democalypse (provided you transfer an offensive skill).
Recovery Amp and discounted Mediarahan let her function as a PvE Healer with a decent offensive presence.","
Has no offensive skills despite possessing Merciless Blow. Heavily relies on transfers for an offensive presence or at least do more than heal.
Not really better than Amaterasu and Barong as a PvE healer/support.
Only obtainable through Democalypse grinding.","
Very good for Dark and Light Alter-World.
As the AI will not cast debuffs in Democalypse, Abaddon A still has an edge over her being able to provide both buffs and debuffs."
"Nyarlathotep","PR","PR","4","5","4","5","3","
Demons die when they are killed by Otherworldly Force, a strong force sweeping skill reminiscient of Echidna's pseudo-endure breaking revive sealing aoe. With 218 magic and innate Force Survivor and Butcher, this skill hits hard.
Additionally gains 35% force damage through panels, only further increasing sweeping potential.
Applies the unique ailment Gloom, which cannot be blocked or cleansed. The only way to remove it is death.
Gloom offers a huge variety of effects, debuffing the opponent's hit rate, evasion rate, crit rate, ailment infliction, and ailment resistance.
In addition, while Nyarly is alive, all enemies will take 25% additional damage from magic and deal 25% less magic damage, as long as they are affected by Gloom
With an absurd four repels, he combos well with Demiurge or Atavaka and he also happens to be a Vile demon, helping him fit with Pales. This is of particular note with him countering Koga Saburo well, as force repel is rare.
Offers buff control in P2 when Gloom is applied, helping him contribute even more to the team.
He is of special note in democalypse prelim rounds, where he adds a 25% damage boost to the entire team.","
While he fits great into Vile teams in theory, his 159 agi will increase the speed of those teams by a good amount, causing you to potentially be outslowed.
Additionally is slow for a fast team, meaning he's a bit awkward to slot into teams.
Has no way to reapply Gloom, so if a unit dies and is revived, the benefits are lost.
Otherworldly Force isn't a true endure breaker, so it won't always be able to punch through enemies, especially if they have multiple endures.
Isn't the tankiest demon so he will struggle to survive in slower teams, and if he dies, the magic damage amp on Gloom is lost.","
Killing Wind in red can be useful to avoid NDR, and pierces thanks to Crawling Chaos"
"Orcus","Y","Y","3","5","3","1","1","
Law of Hell denies bonus turns when weaknesses are struck, while Hell's Gate grants AOE damage reduction for each open weakness.

Very good buff control with War Cry and Nocturne in Yellow.","
Hell's Gate damage reduction does not apply to single target attacks.
Very MP Hungry. Divine brands help with MP costs but reduce his bulk.
Needs specific team compositions to work well.","
You still receive extra damage from open weaknesses.
Due to the way Law of Hell is coded, it will also deny bonus turns gained from a Crit if the attacked demon has a Physical weakness. This ironically makes Slime a great partner for him, as Slime has six open weaknesses including Phys.
Needs specific team compositions to work well."
"Ose Hallel","PR","PTR","4","3","3","4","5","
Heavenly Sword puts him in a state of Charge and Rebellion after a single cast. This allows him to deal OBSCENE damage by spamming it over and over, especially if you have P2 unlocked for the MP reduction. It also bypasses Endures as a bonus.
Sword of Hallel gains boost levels as the fight drags on. At max level, it autocasts Debilitate at the start of turn, which is incredibly valuable for Phys Democalypse Boss Phase.
Can reliably crit for Press Turns thanks to Heavenly Sword constantly putting him in a state of Rebellion.
Phys Amp in Purple greatly increases his damage output. Teal can be used for Repel Phys if you plan to combo him with Repel Pierce units such as Atavaka.
Red gives him access to discounted Hades Blast, which is extremely powerful when combined with the Charge effect from Heavenly Sword. As a bonus, this also evokes memories of simpler times, where Charge + Hades Blast Teal Ose was all the rage in PvP.","
Requires casting Heavenly Sword once to begin the Charge cycle. This mandates one turn of warm up, which can be risky against Intimidating Stance compositions.
Does not gain Charge and Rebellion if Heavenly Sword misses.","-"
"Pale Rider","PT","TY","1","3","2","4","2","
Very good in an Ailment Team, as Pestilence will kill any enemy after 2 turns, no questions asked.
Perfect synergy with a set-up based sweeper Nergal. Nergal helps to remove any barriers and ensures Plague's poison can land via Weak, which in turn triggers his own Meslamtaea passive.
Good AGI and high LUK allow him to work as an Evade Tank.
Gains the strongest debuff Debilitate in Yellow, letting him double as a debuffer.","
Weak to Elec, which is especially bad due to Atropos.
Ailments generally fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats.
Hard countered in PvP by Ailment Cleanser demons and skills, like Daisoujou or Hecate's Lunar Awakening.
Pestilence only kicks in at the end of enemy's turn giving them all the time to cleanse it away or just outright kill him.
Requires a specific team built around him to really work.
Panels 1 and 2 don't contribute to the Ailment build.","
Great choice for Celestial Gui Xian, as the boss does not reduce fractional damage.
Bosses in Strange Signal are not immune to ailments. For new players, he can be a decent demon to kickstart your Aether farming, since his damage is fixed and does not depend on brands or transfers.
Due to the Anti-Ailments nature of the current meta, Pale Rider-centered teams are extremely unsuited for random targeting. Moirai Sisters teams in particular completely counter him, as a Panel 1 Lachesis is enough to ensure Null Poison to her whole team."
"Pales","T","TY","2","3","3","1","1","
Vile Glare provides Intimidating Stance when paired with another Vile, Drake or Jaki demon. This stacks up to twice, giving you double Intimidating Stance if you run two other partners instead.
Cry of the Poor deals Fractional damage at the end of turn, which is useful for cleaning up Endures. If you have three or more Vile/Jaki/Drake demons alive, it will instead of proc twice, letting it break multiple Endures in one go.
Unlike other Racial combos, Vile Glare and Cry of the Poor both work even with just 1 other partner, which allows a lot more freedom in team building.
Incredible synergy with Vile Demiurge - Demiurge helps to fulfill the Vile requirement, while Pales has three Repel and Drain resistances to complement False God and Supreme Creator.
With Panel 1 unlocked and a Rallying Survivor transfer, he can stack up to 85% increased ailment recovery, which means a confirmed Turn 1 recovery from Bind and Charm. This allows him to run a Pseudo-cleric set with a Prayer transfer.
Teal patches up his Fire weakness, while Yellow provides him discounted Recarmdra to further support the team.","
Weak to Fire, which hurts a lot against Surt A and Atropos.
No innate skills means he relies heavily on transfer skills to do anything at all.
Very underwhelming without Demiurge.","
Part of the Vile Team, together with Pales, Demiurge and Ladon. This combination has Anti-Pierce coverage for every element sans Force, has access to double Intimidating Stance thanks to Pales and is generally very bulky."

Low Magic stat wastes his AOE potential, despite having good spells and panels.","-"
"Quetzalcoatl A","P","PR","4","2","2","5","3","
Has full Fire Pierce and Fire Amp by default, plus Butcher in Purple. This makes him a deadly Fire Sweeper for both Fire Democalypse and PvP.
Aztec Pulse costs only 5 MP when maxed and does massive damage when combined with his other passives. The low MP cost also means you can spam it with Divine Brands going first, regardless if Alice A is present or not.
Ce Acatl grants him a free revive once per battle, while refunding the Press Turn lost from his death. This makes him a great counter for Fast T1 Teams on offense, as anything short of a full team wipe will result in him coming back to life and reverse-sweeping with double Aztec Pulses.
Pairs well with Rama as he has Drain Fire by default. This is especially useful versus Herald team compositions to counter Uriel's Sunrise.
Red gives him access to discounted Trisagion, useful versus Fire Anti-Pierce.","
Weak to Dark.
Purple has troubles versus Fire Anti-Pierce comps like Atavaka-Vairocana, Atavaka-Surt A, Demiurge-Ardha, etc.
Hard-countered by Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight.","
As the Press Turn count is determined at the start of the round, Ce Acatl's Press Turn generation only cancels out the lost Press Turn from his death.
Ironically, he also pairs well with his mortal nemesis Skull Knight on defense, as Aztec Pulse will soften up everyone allowing Sword of Actuation to kill anyone his AI desires.
Ce Acatl triggers after Passionate Rage. This allows him to dodge the AOE Chains and abuse any extra Press Turn now available to him."
"Rama","","PTY","4","3","2","3","3","
One of only two demons that can Anti-Pierce through Drain, and thus an invaluable choice for Drain Teams.
Brahmastra is a three-hit Almighty skill that functions as an Endure-breaker.
Good base stats and no weakness allow him to fulfill a variety of roles, be it support or sweeper. Yellow Rama can function as a good support demon with discounted Luster Candy, whereas Purple gives him Ice Pierce which lets him sweep with Mabufudyne.","
Drain Pierce does nothing versus Almighty and Fractional damage, both of which are extremely common in higher tiers of PvP.
Stiff competition from Demiurge, who not only has Drain Pierce but also Repel Pierce and two powerful passives.","
Teal gives him Drain Ice which pairs well with Drain Pierce and can be used to cheese certain difficult PvE content like Hell's Park Floor 100 and Celestial Gui Xian."

Blade of Terror deals consistent Fractional damage based on enemies current HP, unaffected by buffs. It will also bypass the accuracy check since it is a fractional skill.
Blade of Terror has high AOE Bind chance when maxed, and can be used Turn 1 due to its low MP cost. Bind also helps to ensure Bloodshed will not miss.
Bloodshed deals Piercing AOE Physical damage. As it is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if you hit into NDR, similar to Atavaka's Enemy Annihilation chain.","
Blade of Terror falls off later in the fight as it is based on Current HP (and is capped against late game targets in PvE).
Weak to Ice.","
Buffs and damage boosts only work on Bloodshed's Physical damage and not Blade of Terror's Fractional damage."
"Sabaoth","PT","","3","4","4","5","5","
Has midrange potential with Sabaoth's Voice giving him differing effects depending on whether or not his team goes first or second, removing MP from the enemy if they go first or giving his team MP if he goes first. Additionally, he gets a Concentrate effect at the start of the round.
Sanction not only binds and does 80bp Force damage, but also has remnants effect and generates a press turn if used on a bonus turn, once per turn. This makes him a good choice for press turn generation with T1 teams, and also is extremely powerful in Democalypse.
Godly Judgement has pretty good synergy with his auto concentrate effect, letting him do a massive ST almighty nuke, both ignoring endures and sealing revives.","
Doesn't really offer much when used in midrange or T2 teams. He isn't particularly tanky and doesn't offer utility like Shaddai and Orcus neutering press turn generation, or Chi You counter sweeping teams.
Is extremely slow for T1 teams, with only 200 agi after full infusion.
Only really hits hard once, because once the Concentrate effect is gone, Sanction is an 80bp nuke and Godly Judgement being almighty is hard to boost.
Other than democalypse, is often just a decent choice and rarely the best choice for a team.","-"
"Samael","P","P","2","2","2","1","1","
Panel 3 is insanely powerful, providing free Barrier Break and Makara Break at the start of the turn without consuming Press Turns.
God's Malice is very good to lock down a single target with multiple Ailments.
Infinite Chakra helps to reduce MP requirements, allowing him to spam God's Malice.
Mana Aid is a great transfer skill.","
Weak to Elec.
Countered very hard by Daisoujou clearing his ailments and punishing him for using Charm.
Middling AGI hurts Battle Speed for fast Ailment teams.","
Great set of Panels that provide additional Ailment Infliction, reduce MP costs and the aforementioned breaks. Easy 4x4 fusion paths make him a good P3 goal to strive toward.
Compared to Nergal, Panel 3 Samael gives you better Press Turn efficiency, but in return all your other demons will require some degree of Ailment Infliction from brands or transfers. Weigh the extra Press Turn versus stat flexibility carefully.
Panel 3 pairs well with Alice A and Nebiros teams, allowing them to land Curse without worrying about Barriers. He also negates Xi Wangmu's Panel 2, as he will continuously break her recasted Barriers each turn."
"Samyaza","","PY","4","3","3","2","5","
Path of the Mage is both an offensive and supportive passive, reducing the innate cost of his Thunder Reign by 1, giving him force and elec pierce, 20% boost to both force and elec, and reducing the cost of his entire team's magic, ailment, support, and healing skills by 1, allowing his entire team to work better against MP removal.
Thunderforce allows Samyaza to once a turn chain a free Thunder Reign after a teammate (including himself) casts an elec skill, and a free Killing Wind after a teammate casts a force skill. This allows him to rack of massive amounts of damage as his team sweeps. The levels on this skill further increase his elemental damage.
Each awaken skill has its own use, depending on the situation.
Well focused panels that increase his damage output, reduce his costs even further, and increase his battle speed.
Relatively high agi of 201 makes him a decent pick for an elemental sweeping T1 comp.
Two innate repels and a third in teal can help him cheese PvE content.","
Not the best pick for PvP, because HP totals are so inflated that the additional force and elec damage just isn't enough to take down tanks.
As his chain effects will hit random targets when he's on defense, he can't focus a specific target down when he's not being played manually on offense.
Two weaknesses is a liability. Additionally, his teal awaken skill covers neither.
While he's got decent agi, and a little speed in his panels, he's far from as fast as the fastest demons in the game, meaning he can get outsped.","-"
"Schierke","","","3","1","1","4","2","
Summon Elementals debuffs a fixed stat depending on Element. The Rakunda effect from Fire Elemental Summon makes her particularly good for Fire Democalypse.
Access to three elements and innate Mana Aid makes her a useful PvE and Democalypse sweeper.","
You are at the AI's Mercy on which Element gets casted.
Summon Elementals is only useable once every two turns.
Both her skills have levels, making her a very costly investment Kasane-wise.
No Pierce on Elemental Magic.","-"
"Seraph","C","C","3","1","1","2","5","
Very high Magic stat, combined with Garden of Eden and Merciless Blow it lets him hit weaknesses hard.
Innate Trisagion and Thunderclap deal massive damage when targeting weaknesses.
Garden of Eden provides a teamwide boost to damage on hitting weakness, making him perfect for Democalypse.
Panels give him and his teammates even more damage. Can be used in an Archangels team if banking solely on Uriel and Gabriel's passives.","
Only obtainable through Democalypse grinding.
High MP costs make him unsuitable for anything outside Democalypse.
Weak to Ice.","
The best way to build him for both Democalypses is by focusing on one element (most likely Light, see below) by transferring its respective Enhancement skill (ex. Light Enhancement) and Master Assassin. As the +10% damage to weak points given by Enhancements affects all the demon's skills regardless of element, this will ensure a +45% on the chosen element and a +30% on the other one (on comparison, a fully-focused Seraph with both an Amp and an Enhancement gets a total of +50% on the chosen element and of 15% on the other one).
P4 Michael is a great mate for Seraph in Light Democalypse, as they both give damage boost to the whole party (Michael only to Divine/Heralds) and are both of the Herald race, meaning that you can kick in another Archangel (likely Gabriel), boost their damage and proc their passive, for a stellar amount of damage!"
"Seth","PTC","PT","3","2","2","2","4","
Ouas is a piercing, powerful, cheap ST nuke that crits often and heals as well. Additionally, it hits either as Physical or Force damage, depending on what will do more damage.
Extremely high STR and LUK means he will hit hard and crit often.
Teal covers his weakness while Clear gives him an AOE skill in Titanomachia. Purple gives him Force Amp, which is valuable when aiming to use Ouas as a force attack.
Good set of panels that provide him damage, bulk and MP reduction.","
Nothing in his kit boosts Ouas's Damage outside panel 1 and 4. Transfers such as Phys Amp or Master Assassin to cover both elements are near mandatory to boost his damage, especially as HP totals have inflated over the years.
Weak to Fire.
Extremely low MAG means Zandyne is a wasted slot.
Due to elemental Democalypse bosses having 100% crit resist, Force Ouas will not crit without insane amounts of additional crit rate, making it not as powerful as you might expect for force boss.","

Shaddai's Eye is a source of double Intimidating Stance, and additionally grants 70% hp with levels, along with 30% reduction to incoming damage from Crit attacks. Additionally, the opponents will not generate bonus turns when they crit, preventing crit passing.
El Rey is an almighty skill that scales off HP, while additionally granting Debilitate. If used on a bonus turn, it does an additional smaller aoe attack.
Slow, with only 117 agi, along with innate Almighty Slowda, helping cement his role as a strong T2 demon.
Panels grant aoe crit damage reduction, more HP and damage, while also granting Null Mortal helping keep him alive.
When paired with Demiurge, Godly Shield helps fight against Vishnu A teams, draining light and dark.","
Isn't as strong on defense when players can choose whether or not to attack on whole press turns, potentially negating his crit pass denial.
Doesn't do much damage, even at high HP totals.
His panels are pretty important, as he doesn't have Null Mortal before P1, and P2 is a strong source of damage reduction for his team.","
Pairs greatly with Demiurge and Chi You teams, with Chi You fighting Elohim with Repel Fire and Shaddai's Eye handling the full Intimidating Stance needs of the team.
There are translation errors in the Global version, saying Crit Rate Reduction, not Crit Damage Reduction."
"Shiva","R","R","4","2","2","5","3","
High STR, AGI and LUK paired with innate Serial Killer and Vorpal Blade make him an effective Physical Sweeper.
Good candidate for the Hell Gongen team as it patches out his biggest weakness - lack of early Phys Pierce.
Great set of Panels, especially Panel 3 which provides insane MP-cost reduction and Panel 4 which gives him Phys Pierce.
Has three sets of Drain resistances and no weakness if Teal, making him an ideal teammate for Rama or Demiurge.
Pralaya removes Almighty Tetrakarn such as the chain effect from Lord of the Dead. This makes him a good complement for Almighty Physical attackers like Shiva A, who are otherwise walled by it.","
Pralaya has a high MP cost and is blocked by Five Elements.
No Pierce until Panel 4, requiring a lot of investment.
Weak to Ice.
Very expensive to fuse. This is also bad since Kartikeya, one of the most important demons for both PvE and PvP, can only be obtained through a Multi-Fusion involving a Clear Shiva, making it difficult to panel them both at the same time.","
Even paired with Angra Mainyu he still requires Divine Brands to cast Pralaya T1 against Alice A teams."
"Shiva A","PT","PT","4","3","3","3","1","
Third Eye can only be blocked by two demons in the whole game (Griffith and Beelzebub (Human)), going even through Five Elements-like barriers. It is also treated as a Physical attack and as such can Crit.
Ishvara provides auto-Rebellion and passively boosts his accuracy and crit chance.
Insane set of panels that give him everything he needs (accuracy, ST damage and reduced MP cost).
Incredible Elemental resistances especially in Teal. All these Elemental Drains make him an excellent partner for Rama and Demiurge - Drain Elec in particular allows him to soft-counter Passionate Rage.","
Hard to further boost Third Eye's damage outside Butcher due to how rare Almighty Boost and Survivor are.
Weak to Force.
Very MP Hungry and prone to MP denial teams like Alice A.
Completely walled off by Beelzebub (Human)'s Lord of the Dead, as it blocks both Panel 2 and Third Eye.","
Can be run in Hero Masakado T1 Teams for a devastating First Turn Kill.
Shiva and Shiva A can be used together against Beelzebub (Human) for a Pralaya + Third Eye combination. Note though that they will both need Angra Mainyu to cast it T1, and also Divine Brands if Alice A is present."
"Siegfried","R","R","3","2","2","4","4","
Arms Mastery passively boosts his damage and accuracy, letting him sweep hard with discounted Titanomachia in Red.
Innate Drain Phys makes him a decent candidate for Drain Teams.
Incredible set of panels that provides him further damage reduction, Phys Pierce and MP reduction. The Phys Reduction from Panel 1 in particular makes him very useful for Alter-World Phys.","
High investment - He requires Panels, good transfers and a proper team built around him to really shine.
Mediocre AGI and LUK stats.","
Arms Mastery can be stacked with Phys Amp and Epitome of Carnage to skyrocket his Phys damage.
Panel 3 Siegfried is a very good candidate for Hero Masakado T1 Teams, as he can fire off a devastating Titanomachia Turn 1 even against Alice A compositions."
"Skull Knight","PT","PT","3","3","2","2","1","
Demons die when they are killed by Sword of Actuation, unable to be revived. This lets him counter Nebiros, Xi Wangmu and Clotho revive strategies, making him an exceptional Anti-Meta unit.
Sword of Actuation has a ridiculously low MP cost at max level (5 MP) - Even without Panels it can be cast Turn 1 with War Brands. Panel 2 further reduces it to 4 MP, allowing it to be cast regardless of brands or matchup.
Foe of Demons defensively buffs your team at the start of your opponent's turn, increasing your odds of surviving.
Repel Phys in Teal makes him a good partner for Alilat and Atavaka.","
Difficult to boost Sword of Actuation further due to it being Almighty Physical, especially in Purple where Master Assassin is already provided.
Requires a good team setup around him to truly shine.
Middling AGI makes him slightly awkward to fit in fast or slow teams.","
Has AI issues when used on defense - AI will occasionally target demons with high HP instead of trying to finish off demons with Sword of Actuation. This can be circumvented by pairing him with sweepers like Hecate or Atavaka to soften everyone up, ensuring Sword of Actuation will kill whoever his AI targets. Auto-Rebellion also supposedly fixes this issue.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Sraosha","PY","PY","4","4","4","3","3","
His unique Soul Judgement (Sraosha) deals AOE Phys damage whenever an opposing demon dies. This adds to the damage of fast Turn 1 teams and allows him to clear Endures.
High base AGI and innate Speedster make him invaluable for fast teams. Panel 2 further increases his Battle Speed.
Both Soul Judgement (Sraosha) and Soul Break have innate Pierce, giving him more flexibility over transfers.
Death Blow in Purple increases his crit damage. Yellow gives him access to Auto-Sukuka, which can be useful to ensure his attacks do not miss.
Being a Herald, he can be used in an Archangels team to great effect.","
Weak to Dark.
Unimpressive STR means he will need damage transfers to really shine.
Newer demons like Mada, Futsunushi, and Surt A can cause serious troubles with his chain effect.","
Soul Judgement (Sraosha) will trigger Marici's Shimmer Arrow as it counts as a Phys skill. They form a pretty formidable combo especially if Hresvelgr is included to further add North Wind to the chains."

Low AGI, innate Tetra Shift and Intimidating Stance in Clear makes him a great candidate for slow Intimidating Stance Teams.
Ragnarok hits like a truck and refunds MP if maxed, allowing him to cast it repeatedly.
Purple provides Fire Pierce if needed for PvE.","
Weak to Ice.
No innate Fire Pierce if not Purple.","
MATK is the stat to boost, as Ragnarok still greatly relies on it for damage.Â %PATK is recommended as the main sub-stat for brands.
Divine brands are recommended if using him for PvP Defense. Otherwise, his AI will Ragnarok once and then default to spamming Berserker God every other turn, wasting all his damage potential."
"Surt A","","P","3","4","4","5","5","
Low AGI and Intimidating Stance in Purple makes him a great candidate for slow Intimidating Stance Teams, particularly if combined with Moirai sisters, or with Atavaka to also abuse Repel Fire.
Twilight Inferno deals massive damage to the enemy team when he dies, useful against frail T1 teams. This skill will go off even if he is bound on death, revive sealed, etc., there is currently no way to stop it other than killing him last.
Eruption deals respectable AOE damage and procs a random-hit AOE chain if the attack is successful, useful for cleaning up Endures and/or demons who survived the initial hit.
Panel 2 turns his regular attack into a Single-target Nuke dependant on MATK. Not only does this absolve him of any MP issues, it also gives him an out to Fire Anti-Pierce, as he can just nuke another demon instead.
Works well in Battle Tower as the enemy team is forced to either kill him (which procs Twilight Inferno) or deal with extra damage reduction on your MC.","
Weak to Ice.
Heavily dependant on Panel 2, otherwise he is hard-walled by Fire Anti-Pierce like Demiurge + Ardha, Atavaka + himself/Vairocana etc.","
Great synergy with Moirai sisters: Lachesis provides him buff control and completes Intimidating Stance, Atropos further adds to the passive chain effects while Clotho/Xi Wangmu provide revive support.
Has goofy idle animations."
"Susano-o","P","P","3","2","2","1","5","
Very powerful Force nuker. Kusanagi hits extremely hard and autocasts Tarukaja to further buff your team's attack.

"Susano-o A","PTR","PT","3","2","2","2","5","
Innate Epitome of Carnage and Master Assassin in Purple makes him a terrific Phys powerhouse, especially considering Violent Slash's high Base Power and Crit.
Heavenly Valor punishes enemies who pass when used in PvP Defense teams.
Nulls Phys and Drains Force innately. Gains Drain Phys in Teal which goes well with Rama as Phys Anti-Pierce.","
No added Accuracy in his kit. Requires extra Accuracy investment from Brands, Panels or skill transfers to hit reliably.
Weak to Fire.
Heavenly Valor can be countered. Drain Phys teams with Demiurge will have a great time fighting Susano-o A","
Xi Wangmu is a very oppressive partner for him as her passive helps to keep him (and by extension, Heavenly Valor) alive. She also allows him to forgo bulk stats entirely to focus on damage and accuracy.
Heavenly Valor has lower base accuracy compared to typical Physical AOEs."

Ome Acatl is a heavily loaded passive, offering Dark Pierce, a damage amp to cursed enemies, Barrier Break for free if his team attacks first, and a revive punish, doing fractional damage that can curse to the opponent any time an enemy is revived.
Over 200 magic and innate Dark Amp make Yohuallipoca hit hard, especially on a single opponent, doing up to 270 bp to a single target, making him extremely powerful for both the wave and boss phases of democ.
His panels are well suited to his role, offering battle speed, damage, and offensive buff control when an enemy is cursed.
Can be an enabler for fast AG2 farming teams with Alice A, along with BoS Vanity 13.","
Ultimately, Tezca is an ailment demon coming into a meta where the most popular demon, Maria, is ailment immune and has discounted Salvation.
Relies heavily on going first to get his barrier break, but is outsped by the faster demons in the game.
He has niches, especially in democalypse, but he's a demon that just came out too late for what his kit has to offer.
His revive punish isn't as good as you might expect against Maria and Echidna, because those revives activate at the end of your turn and his punish is current hp based and can't kill, meaning you're vulnerable to being counterswept.","-"

Megingjord provides him Crit Resistance and lessens damage from Physical-type skills, making it one of the few skills that can reduce damage from Almighty Physical skills like Third Eye, Sword of Actuation, etc. Panel 2 further increases this.
Thunderous Hammer is a ramping skill that reaches full potential after two casts. At max boost level, it casts a second swing after the first much like Berserk, which is useful for breaking Endures.
The sheer BP of Thunderous Hammer, coupled with Elec Amp in Purple, makes him very powerful for Elec Democalypse.

Flag of Salvation boosts your entire team's light damage, making him useful for Brands of Sin: Sloth 11 and Light Democalypse. It also passively restores 2 MP to your whole party when clearing a wave.
Amakusa Uprising deals heavy single target damage and can crit. Combined with innate Death Blow and Light Amp in Purple it makes him a very strong Light nuker, especially with Panel 2 unlocked. It also provides your team Tarukaja and Sukukaja buffs, allowing your following demons to hit harder.
Great set of Transferable skills, being one of the few sources of Death Blow and Auto-Rebellion.","
Requires Panel 2 to unlock his full potential for PvP, as being able to guarantee crits for extra turns is very powerful.
Only has Pierce through Amakusa Uprising, Mahamadyne in Red does not pierce.
Needs accuracy investment for PvP, as Amakusa Uprising can miss.","
Light is a very good element in the current meta, as several popular demons usually do not have it covered (Alice A, Nebiros and Hecate to name a few).
The additional MP from Flag of Salvation allows your other demons to drop Divine Brands and/or Mana Aid in favor for more offensive brands and passives.
Red gives discounted Mahamadyne. Note that having this unlocked might mess up your Brands of Sin: Sloth 11 runs, as the AI will prioritize it over Amakusa Uprising."

One of the core demons in the Archangels archetype. When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Fire dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins. As it is a chain effect, it doesn't consume Press Turns even when hitting NDR+Anti-Pierce.

Radiant Mantra constantly resets all opponents' buffs and allies' debuffs at the start of the enemy turn. When used in a slow team, this allows him to nullify harmful Auto-skills, giving your other demons more flexibility in skill transfers as they don't have to counter them anymore.
Good Repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat and Atavaka. Fire and Light Repel is especially useful to counter Archangels teams, as it makes him immune to both their AOE elements.
High MAG and Butcher in Purple allows him to function as a strong Almighty sweeper. In addition to dealing respectable Almighty damage, Path of Prominence also applies a mini Luster Candy buff, extending his role as a buff control specialist.

God of Ubiquity is a heavily loaded passive, offering Light and Dark Pierce, Light and Dark Amp, along with a chain effect at the start of his turn that does Dark AoE damage while also reducing their attack and defense.
Nirvana is an absurd ability that ramps up over his turns, dealing Light AoE and more importantly, giving his team an additional press turn once a turn, letting him massively increase his teams potential. It also additionally ramps up to 140 BP and ignores endures, making it an incredibly powerful sweeping skill.
Tar Flexi joins Suk Flexi in skills that grant a team a variable advantage whether or not the team went first.
Panels help make him tankier to help guarantee additional press turns, and increase his MP regen, to the point that with Maria and P2, Nirvana can always be cast as long as it is maxed, meaning no amount of MP drain can prevent it.
Incredible in light democalypse and in certain situations, any democalypse, as press turn generation is king.","
Anti-pierce with Light really shuts him down, preventing him from doing his main roles of damage and press turn generation. This can make him less useful on defense and for randoming in PvP.
A fire weakness and only Null Fire in teal means he can be vulnerable to demons like Adramelech.

Exceptional as a boss unit in elec democalypse.","
Does very little beyond large amounts of elec damage.

Trivializes Brands of Sin Vanity 11, works well for Aura Gate.","
Guilty only works on Boss waves, rendering it useless for PvP and most of PvE.
Picking Red for AOE means losing out on Dark Pierce.
No strong, unique Active to take advantage of his powerful passives. Mudodyne is fairly unimpressive.","-"
"Yoshitsune","PT","PT","5","1","1","4","5","
Widely considered the best demon for PvE as he has access to an AOE in Vorpal Blade, a boss-killing skill in Hassou Tobi, MP refresh in Mana Aid and a damage booster in Phys Amp.
Innate Mana Aid lets him repeatedly spam Vorpal Blade or Hassou Tobi in PvE.
Hassou Tobi does massive damage against lone targets, making it ideal against bosses and Democalypse.
Teal can be used to cheese certain PvE Content.
Excellent set of panels that grant him Accuracy, more MP and more damage.","
Only has innate Pierce on Hassou Tobi.
Random Targetting on Hassou Tobi makes it bad against Waves and in PvP.
Will have MP issues if Panel 2 is not unlocked.","-"
"Zaou-Gongen","R","R","5","1","1","4","5","
Kongo Zaou is a powerful passive that grants Phys Pierce to all your demons under Rebellion. Hell Gongen is a team archetype based specifically around this ability.
Panel 3 grants team-wide Rebellion whenever he crits. This is very powerful for Physical-based Hero Masakado T1 teams, as it cranks up their damage to insane levels and guarantees virtually infinite crits.
Red gives him a cheap AOE attack in Herculean Strike.
While not common, he can work as a Fire Mage as he has passable Magic and Fire Amp in Purple.
Great set of Panels that provide additional damage, accuracy and team-wide Rebellion.","
Weak to Elec.
Middling AGI affects his Accuracy and Speed. Missing can be disastrous for a Masakado A team, as they aim to win on the very first turn.","
Auto-Rebellion is a very powerful transfer skill for him, as it will guarantee he can start the crit loop."
"Zodd","RC","P","3","2","2","3","1","
Rip does AOE Piercing Physical damage and heals him by 50% of the damage dealt. It also refunds 2 MP when maxed, allowing you to spam it repeatedly.
Nosferatu increases his damage every turn (up to 50% after 5 turns). This makes him excellent for long, sustained fights, especially since he can heal himself with Rip.
Mana Aid in Clear is very useful for PvE, as it ensures he can spam Rip every wave.
Very tanky thanks to incredible bulk and Nosferatu providing him a better Enduring Soul. Purple gives him Null Mortal which makes him even harder to kill.
Red gives him access to discounted Megaton Raid. Note that it will not pierce without Panel 2 though!","
Has accuracy issues due to low AGI and middling LUK.
No natural Pierce outside Panel 2 might cause issues when out of MP.","
A very useful unit for beginners to cruise through the early parts of PvE.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Abaddon","TY","TY","1","1","1","1","1","
Null Phys in Teal is handy for early-mid game.
Good STR/VIT.","
Doesn't carve himself any niches that others don't do better.
Maragion serves little use on him due to low MAG stat.
Low AGI.","-"
"Abaddon A","TR","T","4","1","1","1","5","
Lord of the Abyss's auto-debuffs make him a staple demon for all elements of Democalypse (Boss phase).
It is also designed to hard-counter Brands of Sin: Deceit 11.
Repel Phys in Teal and innate Repel Fire are great paired with Alilat
High VIT so he can make use of Muscle Punch","
His PVP role is as Anti-Phys unit when paired with Alilat or Atavaka. But he is outclass by other Repel Phys demons.
Drags speed down greatly due to low AGI which is bad in PVE.
Not good for waves before boss.","
In general good against bosses notably Aura Gate because bosses don't have waves.
Be very mindful of battlespeed when using him for Democalypse bosses! If you are outsped by the Boss, it will cause you to lose one whole round of Debilitate, as it ticks down at the end of the Boss' turn!"
"Agni","PY","P","3","2","2","5","4","
Auto-Rakunda in Purple or Fog Breath in Yellow.
Excellent in all non-Phys Boss Democalypse due to Ignite Def auto-debuff.
Excellent Panel 3 (Fire Pierce (weak) on crack).","
Panel 3 is very hard to get as he is Banner exclusive and aiming for P3 isn't necessarily the best choice because dupe Agni serve well in Democalypse.
Does not have a noticeable damage output kit even Paneled.
Not much better than more common 4-star for PVE.","
Middling AGI: unfit for Fast or Intimidating Stance Teams.
Fire/Dark are his best elements in Democalypse] due to the waves having Rakukaja."
"Anubis","P","P","3","2","2","5","5","
High MAG stat of 217 makes him a good budget mage even for elements other than dark.
A budget choice for any non-Phys Democalypse due to Merciless Blow in Purple.","
Low AGI + Low VIT isn't a good combination for survivability. His downfall mid-game outside of Democalypse.
Doesn't benefit much from his high LUK stat.
No innate AOE and is not the best single target damage dealer either.","
"
"Anzu","PR","YR","2","2","2","5","3","
Decent AGI.
5MP double debuff in Yellow. (also innately has another double debuff)
Excellent demon for Elec Democalypse.","
Force weakness.
Low VIT.
Underwhelming outside of Democalypse","
Unless you want to use him outside Democalypse just use him in Purple for Elec Boost.
Thunder of Destiny is the reason for his excellency in Elec Democalypse due to getting a free weakness/damage multiplier at the beginning of 2nd turn."
"Attis","C","C","2","2","2","1","2","
Innate Enduring Soul and Recarmdra which are good support skills that synergyze well.
No weakness.
The result is he has 2 completely free transfer slot.
Okayish innate bulk in P3.","
Doesn't have many other uses.
Can't make much use of unique skill Mist Slashes despite having decent power behind it's also random target...","
The skills you will transfer to him determine what other supporting role he'll have in addition to 'reviver'."
"Azrael","RC","PR","2","1","1","1","4","
Has access to both Tetrakarn/Makarakarn in Clear, which can serves a niche in Early PvE when you don't have access to many mirrors.
Respectable MAG of 194.
Decent bulk for a mage and panels support it.","
Has no innate skills to boost his good mag stat.
He loses his niche of double karns in late PvE and PvP due to the prevalence of Pierce.","
Outclassed in Democalypse as a Fire/Dark attacker but still good with investment."
"Beelzebub","YC","YC","3","2","2","5","2","
Has high survivability due to Gluttony, which deals good aoe damage and heals himself.
Suitable option for Dark Democalypse and Brands of Sin
No weaknesses.
Synergy with Lucifuge in Yellow.","
Suffers the same issues that Black Frost has in PvP that being Rama + Masakado and Atavaka + Hecate
Stats are subpar even with panels other than MAG.
Gluttony can't be used T1 in PvP.
Requires P3 for Dark Pierce.","
Beelzebub and Black Frost are comparable when it comes to dark damage but Beelzebub at full potential does the most overrall, which requires Panel 1, 2 and Lv 5 Gluttony"
"Beiji-Weng","TYR","PR","2","2","2","5","3","
Surprisingly fast despite being a dude encased in ice, making him a decent choice in speed teams especially with panels.
Good MAG stat and serves as an ice mage.
Is a good demon for Ice Democalypse in Red due to low amount of good ice users.
Can exploit the plentiful amount of demons with an ice weakness.
One of the few Repel Ice demons (in Teal) as well as the cheapest one making him quite useful combined with Alilat against specific PvE content especially Bosses.","
Struggles against bulkier demons like Hecatoncheires and HP sponges in PvE.
Glacial Blast is a redundant skill that serves him little.
No Pierce meaning walled against demons that N/D/R Ice and Judgement isn't a reliable choice against them even at 7 MP.","
While not exactly optimal in PvP, he does have access to Null Curse so he has decent potential when targeting specific teams."
"Beloved","T","T","1","1","1","1","1","
Beloved Slash hits twice, useful for breaking Endures.
Decent STR and Bulk.","
Wasn't beloved enough to get panels apparently
Weak to Dark
No good colors
Low AGI and Middling LUK lead to accuracy issues","
No panels really hurt him. Use a better demon like Wu Kong instead."
"Bishamonten","R","R","1","1","1","1","1","
High STR/VIT
Access to single target/aoe physical skills.","
Low MAG stat meaning Bufudyne is a wasted skill on him

"Cerberus","Y","Y","3","1","1","1","2","
Hell Claw is a strong unique
Versatile demon that can provide multiple roles early-mid pve as support with debuffs/buffs, Physical attacker or even provide some mage coverage.
Works ok on boss wave of physical Democalypse if you're lacking demons for it.","
Falls off hard late game due to his jack of trade nature.
Jack of all trades but only has average stats.
Not much use late game or in PvP.","-"
"Chernobog","PR","PR","2","3","3","2","2","
Ailment chain effect inflicting poison and bind if P3.
Perfect synergy with Nergal.
Decent physical attacker with Dark Sword in Red and innate Hades Blast","
Somewhat low AGI: this is bad for Ailment Team
Strongly needs Nergal to have some viability in PVP.
...but Nergal himself isn't necessarily the best demon for an Ailment Team.","
Needs P3 to be viable in PVP otherwise his usefulness is near none."
"Dantalian","PT","PT","2","2","2","1","2","
Overall decent stats and High MAG/VIT stat.
Functions as tanky mage with supporting skills.
3 resists and 1 null.","
Two weaknesses hurts their viability for the most part.
Doesn't have much niche other than being a tanky mage.
MP expensive skills","-"
"Dionysus","C","C","1","3","3","1","1","
Very high luck stat meaning he inflicts ailments often and doesn't take crits as often.
Panels that benefit from his luck such as crit resist/ailment infliction
Has some potential in stall teams","
Has no attacking skill despite innate back attack
Only can be clear
Only can cause status from Euphoric Frenzy, which only activates when hit physically.
Meaning you have to transfer an ailment skill and else he is a dead weight with no skill to use in battle.","
He doesn't have to be used just to use ailments as he can be used as a surprise ailment counter due to LUK/innate Infernal Mask, this would require a Prayer transfer though and min ailment chance exists."
"Fenrir","PR","PR","4","3","3","3","1","
Budget speedster in Purple and a high AGI stat to take advantage of this.
Innate Auto-Taruka gives him a niche over another budget Speedster Sleipnir.
Versatile enough to allow him to support or be offensive.","
Low offensives stats that are only borderline usable late in the game without high investment.
General low stats outside of AGI.
Two weaknesses is a nuisance if you can't beat the opposition in a single turn.","
He may not be as good as Garuda or Hresvelgr but his staying power as a effective Speedster lasts for some time nor does he need a Speedster transfer.
He is also a LOT cheaper to fuse than the other two."
"Ganesha","T","T","1","3","3","1","2","
His unique passive Faith in Wealth is an anti-Intimidating Stance team that gives 1 MP per turn lost.
High STR/VIT","
Outclassed by Parvati and pairing them both up is overkill.
His unique isn't helpful most of PvE.
Low AGI doesn't help either for his role.
He is passive in most teams he is in due to lack of Pierce.
Two weaknesses.","
He's only outclassed by Parvati. Not necessarily worse, he just doesn't offer as much as her like Auto-Sukuka."
"Girimekhala","R","R","2","2","1","2","2","
High STR stat
Mega Boost is Charge and Rebellion in one allowing him to hit hard the next turn after it's use.
Access to a single target and aoe physical skill.
One of the few demons with repel phys.","
3 Weaknesses.
Low stats outside of STR.
Outclassed by other physical demons of his rarity even with Mega Boost","
His panel 2 gives him a rare -25% to physical damage, which only two 5* have access to Siegfried and Gogmagog."
"Gucumatz","TY","TY","3","2","2","1","1","
Fairly bulky with his given stats/panels.
Low AGI stat but is low enough that it's actually good for slow teams.

Excellent panels","
Two awful innate attacks making him very passive in PvE and PvP.
This diminishes his support role.
Fire Weakness.","-"
"Gurr","PR","PR","2","3","3","2","2","
He is a very high AGI demon with Speedster. In PVE, having one of those (high AGI with Speedster) in the team is near mandatory.
Yaksha Claw a passive quick effect that can inflict Bind: ailment passive quick effects are extremely precious for Ailment Team.
This passive pairs perfectly with Pale Rider one of the strongest ailment demon of the game.","
2 weaknesses
Phys weakness is extremely disavantageous.
Yaksha Claw is random target instead of AOE.","
Yaksha Claw cannot bind if it gets Nulled, Repeled or Drained.
It makes the use of Phys Pierce (weak) mandatory for a PVP build.
Isn't the best Speedster in PvE due to his Phys weakness... But Hresvelgr has Phys Weakness. The difference is Hresvelgr actually does decent damage."
"Hanuman","C","C","2","2","2","3","2","
High STR
Hits hard with Vorpal Blade.
Can work for Autoing Brands of Sin stages","

MahaLantine is a multi-hit version of Maragion, which is appreciated due to fact it helps get passed Endure and it's variants.

Innate drain fire.","
Event only

Middling AGI.","
Not likely to get 4* panels in the future."
"Hecatoncheires","TC","TC","2","3","3","2","1","
High STR/VIT/STR

Guards of Tartarus is a great supporting passive that lowers aoe damage by 15% while he's alive.
Has access to Auto-Rakuka and Drain Phys two excellent skills.","
Needs some accuracy investment on defense to avoid consistent misses plus has to deal with the abundant N/D/R physical.
Two weaknesses
Very passive demon that doesn't do much in the way of damage or even support on his turns.
Is only niche for PvE.","
Getting powercrept by better support demons... And his panels did nothing of note.
Can be used as a ailmenter"
"Hel","PR","PR","2","2","2","3","3","
High MAG stat and serves as an ice mage: both an uncommon and good element as many are weak to it but few Repel/Drain/Null it.
Making her a good candidate for Ice Democalypse
Call to Helheim is pretty decent passive in PvE as opportunities to debuff every wave aren't common.","
Mamudo does little to benefit her and has no Pierce.
Call to Helheim isn't great for PvP due to the typically fast pace nature of it.
She has to kill for Call to Helheim to activate.
Frail and has middling speed.","
Not worth considering for PvP use unless Panel 3."
"Hell Biker","PT","P","4","3","3","1","1","
Makes up one the best PvE teams in the game Hell Gongen.
His role is to cast Red Zone granting might to all; a guaranteed crit to all.
The state of might paired with Zaou-Gongen allows all physical attacks to pierce even those without it.
Innate speedster and top tier AGI 229.
Panel 3 makes Red Zone cost 5 MP.","
He only has average attacking stats.
Maragion isn't a great skill on him.
Only benefits physical demons.","
Isn't nearly as good without Zaou-Gongen."
"Helper Frost","C","C","2","2","2","2","1","
MahaFrosty is a multi-hit version of Mabufula, which is appreciated due to fact it helps get passed Endure and it's variants.
Good for Ice Democalypse especially due to limited options for it.","
Low AGI and only passable MAG stat
Needs Ice Pierce (weak) to be of much use in PvP.","
Unlikely to get 4* panels in the future.
Event Only.
Arguably worse than 1* Jack Frost since he doesn't have Tag, a niche of his 1* self."
"Jeanne d.27Arc","TY","TY","3","3","1","1","1","
One of better 4* support demons
Orlean Prayer can be used to give 3 MP to a demon: in PVP, this can allow some demons to unleash spells they couldn't have T1.
Panel 3 gives Orlean Prayer a 1 turn Tarukaja/Sukukaja, which is fairly useful.
Has a good AGI. Perfect for this strategy.
Infinite use Orlean Prayer.","
Healing is not very powerful in this game.
Despite how good Orlean Prayer in P3 is, PvP is too fast and each Press Turn is too precious for such strategy to be good in general usage.
The AI won't perform such T1 strategy.","
Weak to Fire lol"
"Jikokuten","PY","PY","2","2","2","1","1","
Only demon with the ability Suppress Stance Drain
Can serve a niche early on with his ability especially against bosses in PvE.","
Average stats and two aoes

His ability is too situational to reliably use in PvP even with Rama
Depressing panels","-"
"Kama","C","C","1","1","1","1","1","
Very high AGI and innate Speedster allow him to play the role of Battle Speed booster.
A high damage unique in the form of Divine Bows' Allure with a chance of charming.
Speedster is transferable: he is THE Speedster fodder.","
A pathetic MAG stat making his unique very weak.
Doesn't do anything except boosting Battle Speed.
Outclassed as Battle Speed booster by most 210+ AGI demons.","
Just use Fenrir lol and use Kama as Speedster fodder."
"Kikuri-Hime","TR","PR","2","1","1","3","2","

Dark Pandemic is a cheaper Dekaja if maxed while casting a random debuff.

Low AGI","
Trickster doesn't work in democalypse."
"Long","P","Y","3","2","2","1","2","
A good speed stat and mag for a 4*
Purple gives Mana Aid an excellent PvE skill.
Decent damage output for PvE if a Force AOE is transferred.

High AGI + Dragon Sense allow him to be built as an evade tank.","
Extremely low LUK penalizes the evade tank build.
No innate AoE.
Much better Force users exist for PvP.","-"
"Man Eater","PT","P","2","2","2","1","1","
Her unique passive Sass lowers the defense of the team for 3 turns when the enemy is charmed. Useful in wave based battle due to Auto-Rakunda only working on the first wave nor having to waste a turn casting a defense debuff.
High LUK and access to a rare skill Insanity in Purple making her good at inflicting ailments.
Panel 3 gives Sass an Sukunda effect as well and panel 2 raises ailment infliction.","
Fairly slow making her teams take the risk of being outsped.
Low STR/MAG","-"
"Matador","PYR","PYR","3","3","3","3","1","
Innate EV of 40% with max Andalucia.
Andalucia does a four 30 BP damage physical attacks when he evades a physical attacks.
Excellent AGI/STR stats
All of his archetypes have a niche but Red is preferable in most cases.","
Lack of Physical Pierce hurts his pros greatly as he does only chip damage against physical NDR with even Phys Pierce (weak).
A decision must be made whether he should have more EV% or Physical Attack%.

"Mishaguji","Y","PY","2","2","2","3","1","
Arcane Ritual is a unique that increases the parties ailment recovery by 20%, which isn't bad at all.

Innate Evade helps her dodge and support role.","
Not too many cons to speak of but her role is dependant almost entirely on transfers.
Magic makes short work of her.","
Cat"
"Neko Shogun","C","C","1","3","3","1","1","
His unique Shogun's Order boosts ATK/EVA/Accuracy when enemy is muted. These are the best boosts for the teams, he fits in.
Good AGI/LU stat
Panel 2 and 3 serve him greatly such as granting EV% and Ailment Infliction%.","
Average MAG stat making Mediarama and Mazionga fairly weak for his kit.
Expensive Fusion due to requiring a valuable resource of one of each mitama.","
84 Mitama (21 of each) is required for P3... and still costs a decent sum of 6 mil mag."
"Nidhoggr","PT","PT","1","4","4","2","2","
High survivability due to innate skills (esp. in Purple) and Stats.
Nastrond is very strong in Offense PVP as the AI may not target him first. This allows him to survive popular 'Turn-1-Kill'-Defense Teams reliably. Transfer him Recarmdra to turn the table.
Decent LUK stat makes Mahashibabooon a decent transfer, which is to be cast before Recarmdra to make sure the revived allies won't die ('Turn-1-Kill'-Teams do not use Anti-Ailment techs).","

Asherah a popular reviver gives one press turn with Mother's Creation, which is enough time to possibly come back even with 1 HP especially if Guan Yu is the recipient.

One of the best unit to use for Celestial Gui Xian fight.
Needs to be paired with Rama.","
Low AGI for an ailment team.
Weak skillset for offense despite having a nice mag stat of 206.","-"
"Sleipnir","PR","PR","3","2","2","2","2","
Very good non-unique skills (Speedster and good light attacks).
Decent AGI and a Panel 3 which increases his speed.","
Fenrir and Yatagarasu are better Speedster users.","-"

High MAG.
Mahamaon is a decent spell.
Triggers passives that are strong when going second:
Tetraka Shift has some (limited) use in PVP and early PVE.
in Purple, he has Auto-Rakuka and excellent skill for slow and defensive team.
Cheapest Mediarahan user in Yellow.","
Subpar bulk.
2 weaknesses.
No unique support skill to complement his role in a PVP team.","-"
"Succubus","TR","T","2","1","1","2","2","
High MAG stat of 204
Role is to charm the opposition and hit them with a hard hitting Bufudyne in combination with her passive Deadly Charm.","
Too slow to be a viable ailment demon in PvP.
Average luck stat
No stand out colors that really assist her role.","-"
"Tachikoma","TC","","3","2","2","3","2","
Only 4â˜… that innately Pierces on two elements.
Only 4â˜… that can deal Elemental Phys damage.
Clear gives him Phys Boost which works well with P2. Purple and Teal have decent applications as well.
Works as a cheap Democalypse unit for both Phys and Fire, especially if P3
No weaknesses","
50 mm Grenade Launcher has a use limit.","
Decent VIT and HP stats, along with Weak Phys Pierce on P2 makes him a decent candidate for Earthquake."
"Throne","TR","R","2","2","2","1","1","
Good AGI stat of 163.
This AGI combined with his race being Divine means, with Speedster transferred, he becomes a decent candidate for the powerful 'Archangels' PvP Team.
Innate Void Dark Zones makes him a good candidate for Dmg Panel Immunity
Thus making him a great Aura Gate demon at least early on either on team 1 or 2.","
Superior (though more expensive) candidates for Archangels Teams exist.
Barely passable MAG stat with full investment.
No innate pierce and no innate Single Target skill.
Other options for demons that can act as double null panel/zones.","-"
"Titan","PR","P","2","2","1","3","3","
Good defensive stats with High VIT/STR, which work in conjunction with Muscle Punch.
Has Tetraka Shift, which works with his unique passive Unyielding Phalanx.
Physical Mirrors also work with his unique passive.
No weaknesses","
Relies on Tetrakarn to take reduce damage as he has no innate repel physical.
This makes his niche not as great for PvP as Tetrakarn isn't spammable.
Walled by demons that Null/Drain/Repel Physical without having Phys Pierce (weak)","-"

Top tier MAG
Should be considered for some sections AG2 and any Democalypse other than physical.
Innate Back Attack is useful for both AG2 and Democ","
One of the lowest VIT stats in game and slow to boot. Not a good combination.
No single target skill and Makajamaon is a bad skill on her.
Isn't too great outside of Aura Gate and Democalypse","-"
"Tlaltecuhtli","PC","YC","2","2","2","3","2","
Low enough AGI, that she functions well in slow teams.
Decent MAG stat.
Innate Recarmdra in Yellow gives her a niche due to the skills rarity.
Earth Sacrifice gives a free Tetrakarn upon death and buffs all stats for one turn. Working well with Recarmdra","
Doesn't take hits well as other common Recarmdra users: outclassed by Hecatoncheires another 4*.
If she dies during the opponent's turn, Earth Sacrifice buffs will be gone once your own turn starts.
Ice weakness.
Low AGI forces her into slow teams which makes her low VIT a problem.","-"
"Tsukuyomi","PR","R","2","2","2","1","2","
Strong mage for early to mid PvE
Lunar Blessing is a great unique allowing him to use any skill for 1 MP less; opening up tons of options.
Red has a 3 MP Mudoon due to his unique; meaning no matter what you can cast it.
2 Null and 2 resists.","
Weak to Phys, forcing you to transfer him Resist Phys.
No innate AOE, and his innate attacks are low tier. It mean Lunar Blessing is under-exploited unless you transfer a stronger skill.
On top of that, he has no innate passive that boosts damage.
Low VIT and AGI.","-"
"White Rider","T","T","3","2","2","1","3","
High MAG stat and above average AGI making him a good mage.
His unique God's Bow has a 50% chance of Mortal and be used twice.
This is extremely powerful in PvE against Boss battles, as the adds are rarely immune to Mortal. Closing the app allows you to reset the battle in Aura Gate and avoid you to lose Stamina in other Quest Modes. It means the 50% becomes a 100% with enough resets.","
You can't reset PvP battles making God's Bow very unreliable.
Needs Light Pierce (weak) or Panel 3 against Light-immuned demons
Relies heavily on Ziodyne after God's Bow uses are up... Making Light Pierce (weak) feel like a wasted slot.
Resetting battles over and over to get good rolls can be tiring.","
Not good for Light Democalypse as God's Bow is 2 uses."

Top-tier physical demon for a 4* demon having 235 STR.
Has access to a single target and aoe physical skill freeing up his transfer slots for skills that boost his damage or accuracy.
Great panels that each benefit him
Is an excellent choice for the popular Hell Gongen team as he needs pierce for full potential.
Good panels","
Low AGI forces him to run Speedster in PvP for full efficiency and overall drags down team speed.
No innate pierce, 2 weaknesses and frail.
Zaou-Gongen a demon part of the Hell Gongen core, is already slow himself.","-"

Nice panels","
Middling luck stat, which hinders his role as ailment user.

Judgement of Nahar makes him an excellent pick for ice Democalypse as he casts the equivalent of a Mabufudyne every 2nd turn.

Expensive Fusion.
No innate pierce.
Not to good outside of Democalypse.","-"

Great VIT Stat/Decent AGI
Good candidate for Muscle Punch when he isn't supporting.
Has two innate support skills
'A tanky danger noodle'","
Bad offensive stats outside of using Muscle Punch.
Below average luk making him not the best at hitting his Mashibaboo.
Two weaknesses and both are bad ones to have so he'll need to cover them unless paired with Orcus.
Only one decent awaken skill that being Resist Fire in Teal.","
Best Gummy Worm.

Not great for PvE
Walled by many demons if you choose him for damage without pierce.
Not the best accuracy.","-"
